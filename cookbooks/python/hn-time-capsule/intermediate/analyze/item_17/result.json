  "title": "Device Utilization of PCIe and SATA SSDs",
  "summary": "Published in December 2015, this LogicMonitor blog post documented their transition from SATA SSDs to PCIe (NVMe) SSDs for their high-performance metric storage infrastructure handling 100 billion metrics per day. The article analyzed device utilization metrics as a predictor of SSD performance capacity, demonstrating how PCIe SSDs reduced IO completion time by a factor of 100 (from ~2ms to 0.02ms for writes). The post highlighted technical differences between SATA and NVMe architectures, including kernel scheduler differences and the initial challenges with kernel-level device utilization reporting for NVMe drives.",
  "what_happened": "The article's core thesis proved prescient and correct. By 2026, NVMe PCIe SSDs have completely dominated the storage industry, exactly as the article predicted. The PCIe-based NVMe SSD market grew from nascent adoption in 2015 to a $44.05 billion market in 2024 and is projected to reach $117.27 billion by 2033 (11.9% CAGR). NVMe now accounts for over 60% of enterprise storage installations and 55+ million enterprise NVMe SSDs were deployed in 2023 alone. Meanwhile, SATA SSDs have become obsolete: Samsung ended SATA SSD production in January 2026, and SATA's market share is projected to fall below 10% by 2026. The technical advantages emphasized in the article—superior speed, parallel request handling, and modern scheduler optimization—enabled NVMe to completely replace SATA in enterprise and consumer markets. The article's observation about kernel issues with NVMe device utilization reporting was also validated, with subsequent Linux kernel improvements providing accurate atomic in-flight counters.",

    "user": "Article_Author",
    "reason": "The LogicMonitor engineering team perfectly anticipated the industry trajectory. Their analysis correctly identified PCIe/NVMe SSDs as the future of storage infrastructure despite SATA being the dominant standard at the time. Their technical reasoning about parallel request handling, scheduling improvements, and superior performance characteristics proved to be exactly what drove industry adoption. The article's emphasis on monitoring application-specific metrics rather than relying solely on device utilization also proved sound, as this approach became standard practice in modern observability platforms."

  "most_wrong": {
    "user": "None_Identified",
    "reason": "No comments are available in the dataset to evaluate individual commenters' predictions. However, if we consider the broader industry consensus in 2015, many analysts and IT professionals who believed SATA SSDs would remain viable long-term or predicted a much slower NVMe adoption curve were proven wrong by subsequent events."
  },
  "notable_aspects": "Several interesting technical details proved significant: (1) The article documented early kernel issues with NVMe device utilization reporting showing 100% busy time and queue sizes in the billions—these were genuine kernel bugs that were subsequently fixed, validating the authors' debugging approach. (2) The comparison of write operations increasing from 10,000 to 22,000 per second without merging highlighted how different kernel schedulers (CFQ vs none) fundamentally changed SSD behavior. (3) The article emphasized collecting custom application metrics rather than relying solely on device utilization—this philosophy aligned with the evolution of modern observability platforms and AIOps. (4) The 100x reduction in IO completion time was not theoretical but measured in production, making this one of the most concrete pre-adoption case studies of NVMe benefits. (5) The article's publication date (December 2015) coincided with the beginning of the NVMe transition—making it an early technical validation of what would become inevitable. (6) The comment count of zero is notable—this technical infrastructure article did not generate discussion despite being prescient, suggesting infrastructure-focused content receives less engagement than business or general interest posts on Hacker News.",
