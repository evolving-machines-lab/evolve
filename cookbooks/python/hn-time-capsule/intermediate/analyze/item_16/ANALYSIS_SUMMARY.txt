HACKER NEWS RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS
Article: "Metabase: Why we picked Clojure" (Dec 2, 2015)
Analysis Date: January 2026 (10 years later)

=============================================================================
KEY FINDING: Metabase's bet on Clojure was vindicated
=============================================================================

ARTICLE ARGUED:
- Clojure provides better readability/writability than Java
- "Freedom from Kingdom of Nouns" (fewer wrapper classes)
- Macros provide linguistic flexibility
- Dynamic typing allows faster development
- REPL enables interactive development

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED (2026):
✓ 98 million downloads
✓ 30,000+ companies using Metabase
✓ $43M total funding ($30M Series B in 2021)
✓ $13.4M revenue (July 2025)
✓ 122-person team
✓ #1 open-source business intelligence platform
✓ Clojure is STILL the core technology (active in 2026)

=============================================================================
MOST PRESCIENT COMMENT: jerf
=============================================================================
"When it comes to writing code to deal with a query language, which involves 
having an AST and manipulating it every which way, Java gets creamed by many 
other languages. Both the Lisp series of languages (which Clojure is in) and 
the ML series of languages have wildly better stories for dealing with AST 
manipulation..."

WHY PRESCIENT:
- Correctly identified Clojure's core strength for Metabase's use case
- Query engines require AST manipulation - Clojure excels at this
- Not distracted by general readability debates; focused on domain
- Proved accurate as query language became key differentiator

GRADE: A+

=============================================================================
MOST WRONG COMMENT: devundef
=============================================================================
"This is probably going to be a very unpopular opinion here, but I think 
Clojure is a horrible language to work with... Clojure does not fit my brain."

Predicted:
- Poor error messages and steep learning curve would be fatal
- Team knowledge issues would doom Clojure projects
- The language doesn't fit developers' mental models

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:
- Team scaled from founders to 122 people, all working in Clojure
- Successfully onboarded many new developers over 10 years
- Built one of the most successful open-source companies

GRADE: F (maximally wrong)

=============================================================================
OTHER NOTEWORTHY COMMENTS
=============================================================================

slowmovintarget (Grade: A)
- Recognized data-oriented architecture as fundamental advantage
- "I'm thinking about what shape the data should be" philosophy
- Proved prescient for query language architecture

tlrobinson (Metabase dev, Grade: B+)
- Showed team confidence in Java interop benefit
- "If no one has created a nice Clojure library, use Java libraries"
- Insider perspective validating the choice

kisstheblade (Grade: C)
- Made fair points about Java's tooling and readability
- Criticized lack of articulation about Java's problems
- Represented "losing" side in this debate

biokoda (Grade: C-)
- Suggested Erlang/Elixir would be better
- Overlooked that Clojure's Java interop solved database driver concerns
- Partially right about criteria but wrong about implications

=============================================================================
DISCUSSION THEMES
=============================================================================

Java Criticisms: 11 comments
- Verbosity, "Kingdom of Nouns," ceremony required
- But no specific articulation of domain problems

Clojure Criticisms: 14 comments
- Steep learning curve
- Poor error messages
- Small ecosystem at the time
- But mostly subjective ("doesn't fit my brain")

Language Comparisons: 28 mentions of Go, 12 of Scala, 6 of Erlang
- Erlang highlighted as gap in evaluation
- Scala seen as previous failed attempt

=============================================================================
RETROSPECTIVE SCORE: 8/10
=============================================================================

HIGHLY INTERESTING BECAUSE:
1. Captures genuine technology debate with definitive outcome
2. Contains prescient technical insight (jerf on AST manipulation)
3. Shows how domain-specific needs > general language philosophy
4. Metabase's 10-year success validates the choice decisively

NOT 10/10 BECAUSE:
1. Most debate was about subjective language philosophy
2. Few commenters discussed business factors
3. Clojure's claimed benefits (readability, maintainability) are subjective
4. Hard to definitively grade subjective perspectives

CONCLUSION:
This is an excellent retrospective. The 2015 skeptics weren't wrong about
Clojure's learning curve or ecosystem immaturity - they were wrong about
whether these factors mattered for a company with strong technical founders
and access to Java libraries. The prescient insight was recognizing that
Clojure's strengths (AST manipulation, persistent data structures, macros)
directly addressed Metabase's core problem domain.
