  "title": "Use micromorts to fight terrorism",
  "summary": "This November 2015 article, written just days after the Paris attacks (130 deaths), argues for using micromorts—a unit representing a one-in-a-million chance of death—to rationalize fear of terrorism. The author contends that the 2.5 micromorts from the attacks is comparable to everyday risks like motorcycle riding, and that understanding this statistically makes terrorism less terrifying. The 90-comment discussion reveals deep disagreement: some commenters agreed with the probabilistic approach, while others argued that terrorism is fundamentally different from random accidents, that it deserves a proportional response on moral grounds, and that micromort calculations fail to account for black swan events, geographic variation, and the psychological impact of deliberate violence.",
  "what_happened": "The article's statistical optimism proved prescient in some ways, wrong in others. Globally, 2015 was indeed the deadliest year for terrorism at 29,376 deaths, but the trend has been decisively downward. By 2022, deaths fell to 6,701 (77% lower than 2015's peak). However, this rebounded to 8,352 deaths in 2025, still 71% below the peak. ISIS, which was at its apex in 2015 when the article was written, collapsed dramatically: it lost 95% of its territory by December 2017 and was effectively defeated by governments by November 2017. Yet terrorism didn't disappear as a concern—it simply shifted geographically and evolved tactically. France itself experienced ongoing security challenges, with the state of emergency lasting years and cultural impacts persisting. The article's fundamental claim—that terrorism poses a statistically minor risk—remains true and has become easier to demonstrate with hindsight, yet governments and citizens have not behaved according to this logic, continuing massive security expenditures and policy changes.",
  "most_prescient": {
    "user": "douche",
    "reason": "Predicted that terrorism attempts would remain vanishingly rare due to the small pool of people willing to execute such attacks despite the relatively low barriers to entry. This observation proved accurate: despite ISIS being at its peak in 2015, and despite the subsequent decade allowing multiple opportunity windows, large-scale coordinated terror attacks on Western soil remained rare. The commenters pointing out that terrorism as a statistical risk has declined dramatically since 2015 were validated by actual data."

  "most_wrong": {
    "user": "hokkos",
    "reason": "Predicted dramatically escalating personal risk when accounting for age and location specificity ('my micromort explode to the roof now'). Claimed 147+ deaths from terrorism in Paris alone in 2015 and predicted an exponential risk trajectory. In reality, Paris and France experienced no subsequent attacks of comparable scale, and the person's pessimistic update to personal risk proved unfounded. The commenters who treated the 2.5 micromorts as the true risk estimate proved closer to reality than those who thought terrorism would escalate geometrically."
  },
  "notable_aspects": "1) The discussion reveals a fundamental philosophical divide: those who believe risk assessment should be purely statistical vs. those who believe moral/political significance matters independently of probability. 2) Several commenters made sophisticated statistical arguments about small sample sizes and black swan events that actually undermine the micromort analysis more than support it. 3) The tangent about Japanese mocking ISIS on Twitter while denying halal food to Muslim exchange students shows cultural context-sensitivity was present even in the discussion. 4) Multiple commenters presciently identified that overreacting to terrorism through military spending and surveillance actually plays into ISIS's strategic goals—a concern that had some validity given subsequent Middle East interventions. 5) The debate about whether 'terrorism' is terrorism vs. 'state violence' is terrorism mirrors genuine definitional disputes that persist today. 6) Several commenters made the astute observation that humans are terrible at proportional risk assessment regardless of information provided, and that rational arguments about micromorts would be 'entirely ineffective' at changing fear.",

  "score": 7,
  "rationale": "Interesting retrospective because it crystallizes the exact moment (November 2015, peak ISIS) when rational risk assessment collided with genuine threat, creating a time capsule of the 'micromorts as a rationalist tool' approach. The article is both proven right (terrorism did remain statistically rare) and proven irrelevant (the rational argument changed no one's behavior). The comments are unusually sophisticated for HN, with actuaries, statisticians, and serious thinkers grappling with whether probability theory can overcome emotion. The decade of hindsight reveals that global terrorism peaked precisely when this article was written, and declined 77% by 2022—making the original optimism prophetic by accident. However, the discussion's deeper insight (that rationalist frameworks fail to move human behavior on existential anxiety) proved more durable than either the optimistic or pessimistic predictions about terrorism itself. Not a 10 because the 'what actually happened' is less wild/surprising than ideal retrospectives—terrorism declined as many hoped but policy didn't rationalize as the article advocated. Interesting primarily as a artifact of its exact historical moment and the limitations of rational persuasion."
