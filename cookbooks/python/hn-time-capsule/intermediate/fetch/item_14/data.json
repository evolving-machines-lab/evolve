A common-gender third-person pronoun, singular\nthey\nhas been popular in English speech and writing for over 650 years. Although frequently classified by purists as ungrammatical, its use seems undiminished, and it may even be on the rise because it fills an important linguistic niche. In recent years, more and more English speakers have sought a gender-neutral alternative to pronouns that express the traditional male/female binary, turning either to invented pronouns like\nxe\nand\nzie\n, or to that old stand-by, singular\nthey.\nBecause singular\nthey\nhas witnessed a dramatic rehabilitation over the past year\n,\nthe Web of Language Distinguished Usage Panel unanimously chose to honor it as word of the year for 2015.*\nSingular\nthey\nwas Word of the Year back in 1365, when it first appeared in English as a gender-neutral English pronoun. It won again in 1885, when it was praised in the Atlanta\nConstitution\nfor triumphing over the ignorant opposition of grammarians and lexicographers\n.\nThat award was later asterisked because most speakers of English, who regularly used singular\nthey\nin speech and writing, capitulated to the\u00a0purists who insisted that it was an illiterate blunder.\nThe history of\nthey\ngoes back well before the fourteenth century.\nThey\nwas originally a plural pronoun, borrowed by the Anglo-Saxons from Scandinavian invaders. If you think that using\nthey\nas a singular offends the purity of English grammar, get over it. As we learn from the BBC docudrama, \u201cThe Last Kingdom,\u201d\nthey\nis an immigrant word that waded\u00a0ashore with undocumented Danes in the ninth century and became thoroughly English, just as the Danes did.\nTo be fair, the Anglo-Saxons probably thought, when they first heard it, that plural\nthey\nwas as barbaric as the Vikings who brought it, but English speakers gradually found themselves using plural\nthey\u2014\njust as Modern English speakers use singular\nthey\u2014\nbecause it did something no native English word could do. By the time \u201cthe Northmen\u201d came to England, Anglo-Saxon third-person pronouns were starting to sound alike. Old English\nh\u0113,\n\u2018he,\u2019 was getting confused with\nh\u0113o,\n\u2018she,\u2019 and both were sounding more and more like\nh\u012be,\n\u2018they.\u2019 Having so many pronouns with similar pronunciations made it harder to tell who was who in any given sentence: Are you talking to\nhim\n(singular)\n?\nAre you talking to\nhim\n(plural)\n?\nDespite its foreignness, an\u00a0imported word made things so much clearer: Are you talking to\nthem?\nThen, over time, the newly-nativized plural\nthey\nbegan to fill in as a singular when gender was unknown or irrelevant. No other word seemed able to do that. This blurred the singular/plural distinction again, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter, since context could still indicate whether the pronoun referred to one or more than one.\nFor most of its long history, singular\nthey\nwasn\u2019t controversial. But toward the end of the eighteenth\u00a0century, some American language commentators began fussing about its correctness. In 1794, three women responded to a complaint about\u00a0their use of singular\nthey\nin a newspaper article\u00a0by saying, \"we wished to conceal the gender,\" and they invited their critic\u00a0to coin an alternative pronoun (\nThe Medley, or Newbedford (MA) Marine Journal,\nMarch 4, 1794, p.2).\nOther calls for a new pronoun \"of the common gender\" begin to appear around that time--in 1808 Samuel Taylor Coleridge suggested that the pronoun\nit\nmight work \"in order to avoid particularising man or woman, or in order to express sex indifferently\"\u00a0(\nAnima Poetae\n[1897],\u00a0p. 190). From the 1850s on,\u00a0in newspaper columns headed \u201cThe Missing Word\u201d or \u201cA Needed Word,\u201d wordsmiths complained that using\nhe\nfor both men and women was ungrammatical, since pronouns are supposed to agree with their antecedents\u2014the words they refer to\u2014in\ngender\nas well as number, and generic masculines like\nhe\nviolate that\u00a0gender agreement rule. They also called singular\nthey\n\u201cilliterate\u201d because it violates the number agreement rule.\nAs early as 1851, a the Lowell, MA,\nMorning News\ncalled for the invention of a common-gender pronoun to solve the problem of what word\u00a0to use when referring to a singular common-gender noun like\nperson\n, or\ngrammarian,\nor\nvoter\n: \u201cWill not some of our grammar makers \u2018fish us up\u2019 one?\u201d (reprinted in the Brattleboro, Vermont,\nSemi-Weekly Eagle,\nJan. 1, 1852). In 1875, an Ohio newspaper, also in the new-pronoun camp, called singular\nthey\na \u201cblunder\u201d sometimes found in good writing and ubiquitous in advertising, and in a burst of feminism, warned against the generic\nhe,\n\u201cbecause the instincts of justice are stronger than those of grammar\u201d (Findlay, Ohio,\nJeffersonian,\nMay 14, 1875, p.1). And two years later, a pseudonymous writer facetiously suggests that\num,\ncoined \u201cyears ago by some linguistic genius,\u201d is as good a pronoun as any: \u201cIf any person is dissatisfied with the language as it now stands, we should recommend um to adopt it\u201d (Inter Ocean, writing in the Nebraska\nAdvertiser,\nBrownville, NE, October 4, 1877, p. 1).\nRecommending the use of the invented common-gender pronoun\nE\n, in 1878 an Illinois paper observed that in order to avoid both generic masculine and singular\nthey,\n\u201cscholars\u201d must resort to ridiculous circumlocutions:\nLet every brother or sister examine himself or herself, and, looking into his or her heart, find out his or her besetting sin and resolutely cast it from him or her.\nSteering a course between illiteracy and pretension, the author of \u201cThe Missing Word\u201d promotes\nE\nas \u201cjust as good a pronoun for the third person as \u2018I\u2019 is for the first,\u201d claiming that the paradigm\ne, es, em\nhad been proposed \u201cby somebody over a year ago,\u201d and illustrating its aptness with this sentence:\nLet every brother and sister examine \u201cemself,\u201d and, looking into \u201ces\u201d heart, find out \u201ces\u201d besetting sin and resolutely cast it from \u201cem.\u201d\nDelete\nEdit\nembedded media in the Files Tab and re-insert as needed.\nalign image left\nalign image center\nalign image right\nExcerpt from \u201cThe Missing Word,\u201d\nThe Morning Star and Catholic Messenger,\nNew Orleans, Nov. 17, 1878, p. 1; reprint of an article that first appeared in the\nMoline\n(IL)\nDispatch,\nand referencing an earlier discussion of pronouns in the Peoria, IL,\nDaily Tribune.\nE\nnever took off, despite being\nreinvented independently\nin 1890, 1977, 1989, and 1992 (and perhaps more recently as well). Other invented common-gender pronouns like\nthon\n(1884) and\nheer\n(1912) shared the same oblivion, even though they appeared in respected dictionaries. Lately,\u00a0pronouns like\nxe and zie,\nhave generated interest,\u00a0particularly among transgender and gender-nonconforming persons, but even when these coined words aren't stirring up controversy, they always seem out of place, and their use remains limited.\nIn contrast,\nsingular\nthey\n,\nwhich arose naturally and has been in widespread use for centuries both in speech and in writing, is showing strong signs of becoming accepted. Although frequently condemned as ungrammatical, singular\nthey\nhad at least one early advocate. C. K. Maddox, writing in the\nAtlanta Constitution\nin 1885, rejects the invented\nse, sis, sim,\nand calls grammarians and dictionary makers \u201cpositively stupid\u201d for failing to recognize the popular common-gender use of singular\nthey,\nwhich is \u201cin daily practice among the people.\u201d As Maddox notes, singular\nthey\nin literature \u201cis so natural to the genius of our language that hardly one in a hundred has noticed it as an intrusion\u201d (\nAtlanta Constitution,\nreprinted in the Anderson, South Carolina,\nIntelligencer\n, May 21, 1885, p. 4; a C. K. Maddox is listed as alderman and tax collector in Atlanta around that time).\nIf you think singular\nthey\nis wrong because a plural pronoun can't refer to a singular noun, you're wrong:\nyou,\noriginally plural, has doubled as\u00a0the standard English singular second person pronoun for hundreds of years, and no one's longing to return to the good old days of of Merrie England when people called each other\nthou, thee,\nand\nthy.\nSome\u00a0of today\u2019s style guides continue to regard singular\nthey\nas an error, but that opposition is evaporating rapidly. The fourteenth edition of the\nChicago Manual of Style\napproved singular\nthey\n(1993, pp. 76-77n.),\u00a0but responding to criticism of this decision, the editors of the influential style guide walked back that decision in the current, sixteenth, edition (2010; sec. 5.227). But most of the other major style books now authorize singular\nthey,\nparticularly in reference to an indefinite noun.\nThe latest edition of\nThe New Fowler\u2019s Dictionary of Modern English Usage\n(1996) dismisses objections to singular\nthey\nas unsupported by the historical record of English and observes that, with few exceptions, the construction is \u201cpassing unnoticed\u201d by speakers of standard English as well as by copy editors. Singular\nthey\nis also \"approved\" by the\nOxford English Grammar;\u00a0The New Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage; The New Oxford Dictionary; the New Oxford American Dictionary; Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary;\nand the\nCambridge Guide to English Usage.\nThis year singular\nthey\nwas recommended by the Candian Department of Justice Style Guide and by the\nWashington Post Style Book.\nSingular\nthey\nhas passed the test of time and good usage. Even its harshest critics use singular\nthey--\na sure sign that resistance is futile.\u00a0As popular resistance to grammatical and to gender nonconformity continues to weaken, it\u2019s time for singular\nthey\nto take its rightful place in the paradigm of English personal pronouns. Singular\nthey\nwon\u2019t bring about a linguistic meltdown or end gender discrimination, but it\u2019s been flourishing bravely despite fierce opposition, and it\u00a0clearly merits the honor of being the 2015 Word of the Year.\n-----\n*Truth in advertising: The Web of Language Distinguished Usage Panel, charged each year with picking the Word of the Year, consists entirely of me.\nFor the whole story on gender-neutral and nonbinary pronouns, click to order your copy of my new book,\nWhat\u2019s Your Pronoun?

It's a vague generality, when the individual attributes of a person are unknown or irrelevant.It's like when one speaks in general ways that apply to all mankind, and you might even use the word \\\"you\\\" to refer to, not YOU, but anyone.\\\"They\\\" works great because a group is a vague fuzzy kind of thing. In the plural form, speaking of them, over there, and their attributes, it's not so much about the plurality, as it is the abstract fuzziness of it.All that we're doing is applying that same fuzziness in the direction of what could possibly be a smaller target in terms of numeration.That is why, I don't think those rules about singular and plural were ever really correct. It isn't the numbers that we were trying to convey with the words, but the fuzziness.\\\"He\\\" and \\\"She\\\" are referencing specific object types with common properties across the whole of the specific object. Whereas \\\"They\\\" is referencing an object with either mixed or unknown properties.Do you see what I'm saying? It isn't about the count, but the uniqueness of known attributes for a specific target. It just so happens that when you have many of an object, the commonality of attributes blurs, and so the \\\"they\\\" pointer appears to be about the number of objects. Then some people who aren't thinking beyond that get upset if you violate the number when using they to point to >1.When really, it's just about fuzz.I don't use \\\"they\\\" as any kind of feminist thing. I just think that \\\"he or she\\\" is not only incredibly distracting and inefficient, but it is the illogical one.

Take German with das M\u00e4dchen (das being neuter gender), the plural of this is die M\u00e4dchen, aka all plurals in German are feminine gender.This is a complicated area and I'm not sure that the issues in German occur in the same places as in English: in English, for people, the exclusive dual grammatical gender has been paired with and directly mapped to (but for the use of the masculine grammatical gender to include generic ascribed gender) the exclusively dual socially ascribed gender, to which personal gender identity has been generally expected to conform. With languages with a more complex gender structure and where the mapping between grammatical gender and socially ascribed gender of persons is more complex, the particular problem areas (if any) where grammatical gender is problematic in terms of interfering with the desire to encourage socially ascribed gender to align with gender identity and, also, to avoid communicating gender(-identity/ascription) biased norms, may be different than in English.It may be different, for that matter, even within a single language, based on the history and expectations around the use words and their associations in different places and cultures using the same language.\",\n    \"points\": null,\n    \"depth\": 5,\n    \"created_at\": \"2015-12-01T23:16:46.000Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"SilasX\",\n    \"text\": \"It doesn't matter whether it's related to biological gender[1]; the fact remains that these languages force you to remember extra information that serves no semantic purpose, which causes the same problem as English does/did when forcing you to pick a gender for the pronoun of a generic person.Whether you call it \\\"grammatical gender\\\" or \\\"gender\\\" or \\\"noun class\\\" is irrelevant; it all burns down the same cigarette butt.[1] Although it pretty clearly is, since languages consistently lump in the female version of a human noun (cartera) with the grammatical gender of woman, and male (cartero) with man; the little-girl exception you mention from German is because that diminutive suffix (-chen in M\u00e4dchen) takes the neuter case with higher priority.
