Singular
they
is word of the year for 2015. A common-gender third-person pronoun, singular
they
has been popular in English speech and writing for over 650 years. Although frequently classified by purists as ungrammatical, its use seems undiminished, and it may even be on the rise because it fills an important linguistic niche. In recent years, more and more English speakers have sought a gender-neutral alternative to pronouns that express the traditional male/female binary, turning either to invented pronouns like
xe
and
zie
, or to that old stand-by, singular
they.
Because singular
they
has witnessed a dramatic rehabilitation over the past year
,
the Web of Language Distinguished Usage Panel unanimously chose to honor it as word of the year for 2015.*
Singular
they
was Word of the Year back in 1365, when it first appeared in English as a gender-neutral English pronoun. It won again in 1885, when it was praised in the Atlanta
Constitution
for triumphing over the ignorant opposition of grammarians and lexicographers
.
That award was later asterisked because most speakers of English, who regularly used singular
they
in speech and writing, capitulated to the purists who insisted that it was an illiterate blunder.
The history of
they
goes back well before the fourteenth century.
They
was originally a plural pronoun, borrowed by the Anglo-Saxons from Scandinavian invaders. If you think that using
they
as a singular offends the purity of English grammar, get over it. As we learn from the BBC docudrama, “The Last Kingdom,”
they
is an immigrant word that waded ashore with undocumented Danes in the ninth century and became thoroughly English, just as the Danes did.
To be fair, the Anglo-Saxons probably thought, when they first heard it, that plural
they
was as barbaric as the Vikings who brought it, but English speakers gradually found themselves using plural
they—
just as Modern English speakers use singular
they—
because it did something no native English word could do. By the time “the Northmen” came to England, Anglo-Saxon third-person pronouns were starting to sound alike. Old English
hē,
‘he,’ was getting confused with
hēo,
‘she,’ and both were sounding more and more like
hīe,
‘they.’ Having so many pronouns with similar pronunciations made it harder to tell who was who in any given sentence: Are you talking to
him
(singular)
?
Are you talking to
him
(plural)
?
Despite its foreignness, an imported word made things so much clearer: Are you talking to
them?
Then, over time, the newly-nativized plural
they
began to fill in as a singular when gender was unknown or irrelevant. No other word seemed able to do that. This blurred the singular/plural distinction again, but that didn’t seem to matter, since context could still indicate whether the pronoun referred to one or more than one.
For most of its long history, singular
they
wasn’t controversial. But toward the end of the eighteenth century, some American language commentators began fussing about its correctness. In 1794, three women responded to a complaint about their use of singular
they
in a newspaper article by saying, "we wished to conceal the gender," and they invited their critic to coin an alternative pronoun (
The Medley, or Newbedford (MA) Marine Journal,
March 4, 1794, p.2).
Other calls for a new pronoun "of the common gender" begin to appear around that time--in 1808 Samuel Taylor Coleridge suggested that the pronoun
it
might work "in order to avoid particularising man or woman, or in order to express sex indifferently" (
Anima Poetae
[1897], p. 190). From the 1850s on, in newspaper columns headed “The Missing Word” or “A Needed Word,” wordsmiths complained that using
he
for both men and women was ungrammatical, since pronouns are supposed to agree with their antecedents—the words they refer to—in
gender
as well as number, and generic masculines like
he
violate that gender agreement rule. They also called singular
they
“illiterate” because it violates the number agreement rule.
As early as 1851, a the Lowell, MA,
Morning News
called for the invention of a common-gender pronoun to solve the problem of what word to use when referring to a singular common-gender noun like
person
, or
grammarian,
or
voter
: “Will not some of our grammar makers ‘fish us up’ one?” (reprinted in the Brattleboro, Vermont,
Semi-Weekly Eagle,
Jan. 1, 1852). In 1875, an Ohio newspaper, also in the new-pronoun camp, called singular
they
a “blunder” sometimes found in good writing and ubiquitous in advertising, and in a burst of feminism, warned against the generic
he,
“because the instincts of justice are stronger than those of grammar” (Findlay, Ohio,
Jeffersonian,
May 14, 1875, p.1). And two years later, a pseudonymous writer facetiously suggests that
um,
coined “years ago by some linguistic genius,” is as good a pronoun as any: “If any person is dissatisfied with the language as it now stands, we should recommend um to adopt it” (Inter Ocean, writing in the Nebraska
Advertiser,
Brownville, NE, October 4, 1877, p. 1).
Recommending the use of the invented common-gender pronoun
E
, in 1878 an Illinois paper observed that in order to avoid both generic masculine and singular
they,
“scholars” must resort to ridiculous circumlocutions:
Let every brother or sister examine himself or herself, and, looking into his or her heart, find out his or her besetting sin and resolutely cast it from him or her.
Steering a course between illiteracy and pretension, the author of “The Missing Word” promotes
E
as “just as good a pronoun for the third person as ‘I’ is for the first,” claiming that the paradigm
e, es, em
had been proposed “by somebody over a year ago,” and illustrating its aptness with this sentence:
Let every brother and sister examine “emself,” and, looking into “es” heart, find out “es” besetting sin and resolutely cast it from “em.”

Excerpt from “The Missing Word,”
The Morning Star and Catholic Messenger,
New Orleans, Nov. 17, 1878, p. 1; reprint of an article that first appeared in the
Moline
(IL)
Dispatch,
and referencing an earlier discussion of pronouns in the Peoria, IL,
Daily Tribune.
E
never took off, despite being
reinvented independently
in 1890, 1977, 1989, and 1992 (and perhaps more recently as well). Other invented common-gender pronouns like
thon
(1884) and
heer
(1912) shared the same oblivion, even though they appeared in respected dictionaries. Lately, pronouns like
xe and zie,
have generated interest, particularly among transgender and gender-nonconforming persons, but even when these coined words aren't stirring up controversy, they always seem out of place, and their use remains limited.
In contrast,
singular
they
,
which arose naturally and has been in widespread use for centuries both in speech and in writing, is showing strong signs of becoming accepted. Although frequently condemned as ungrammatical, singular
they
had at least one early advocate. C. K. Maddox, writing in the
Atlanta Constitution
in 1885, rejects the invented
se, sis, sim,
and calls grammarians and dictionary makers “positively stupid” for failing to recognize the popular common-gender use of singular
they,
which is “in daily practice among the people.” As Maddox notes, singular
they
in literature “is so natural to the genius of our language that hardly one in a hundred has noticed it as an intrusion” (
Atlanta Constitution,
reprinted in the Anderson, South Carolina,
Intelligencer
, May 21, 1885, p. 4; a C. K. Maddox is listed as alderman and tax collector in Atlanta around that time).
If you think singular
they
is wrong because a plural pronoun can't refer to a singular noun, you're wrong:
you,
originally plural, has doubled as the standard English singular second person pronoun for hundreds of years, and no one's longing to return to the good old days of of Merrie England when people called each other
thou, thee,
and
thy.
Some of today’s style guides continue to regard singular
they
as an error, but that opposition is evaporating rapidly. The fourteenth edition of the
Chicago Manual of Style
approved singular
they
(1993, pp. 76-77n.), but responding to criticism of this decision, the editors of the influential style guide walked back that decision in the current, sixteenth, edition (2010; sec. 5.227). But most of the other major style books now authorize singular
they,
particularly in reference to an indefinite noun.
The latest edition of
The New Fowler’s Dictionary of Modern English Usage
(1996) dismisses objections to singular
they
as unsupported by the historical record of English and observes that, with few exceptions, the construction is “passing unnoticed” by speakers of standard English as well as by copy editors. Singular
they
is also "approved" by the
Oxford English Grammar; The New Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage; The New Oxford Dictionary; the New Oxford American Dictionary; Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary;
and the
Cambridge Guide to English Usage.
This year singular
they
was recommended by the Candian Department of Justice Style Guide and by the
Washington Post Style Book.
Singular
they
has passed the test of time and good usage. Even its harshest critics use singular
they--
a sure sign that resistance is futile. As popular resistance to grammatical and to gender nonconformity continues to weaken, it’s time for singular
they
to take its rightful place in the paradigm of English personal pronouns. Singular
they
won’t bring about a linguistic meltdown or end gender discrimination, but it’s been flourishing bravely despite fierce opposition, and it clearly merits the honor of being the 2015 Word of the Year.
