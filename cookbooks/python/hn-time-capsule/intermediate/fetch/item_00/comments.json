Their critics at the time claimed this was really because they didn't want other browsers competing with Safari, and they'd never let anyone have it because of that. Then when Apple developed the XPC framework allowing secure remote execution, they opened up the JIT engine to third party browsers in a secure way.So far Apple's actual behaviour has been completely consistent with their stated reasons, which are not the reasons you are 'quoting' from somewhere, and in several respect contrary to the predictions of their critics. Isn't it possible that they are being honest about their motives?But on the other hand, yes, the Mac App Store is a broken mess.

    "text": "Apple has completely lost the goodwill of Mac developers. The one and only reason the ones that haven't gone bankrupt are still staying is because they have no other choice due to platform lock-in. Every single conversation that I've had with indies recently have gone along the same lines: Apple is killing the indie scene.I wrote about the MAS exodus [1] more than a year ago and people were skeptical back then. Think again - here's a list of great apps [3] that are only available outside the MAS. Those are not just small time hobbyist apps - those are professional tools.Pieter (founder of Bohemian, company behind Sketch) listed many problems with the MAS at a recent conference [5]. Wil Shipley (well-known within the community) has also written about it [6].And now you have another flagship OS X app ditching the MAS due to the multitude problems it creates. The message is loud and clear - if you're a real software business, not a hobbyist at home, don't waste your time with the MAS - it simply does not allow you to run your busienss properly.When the companies building the flagship apps for the platform publicly state they cannot do business due to the restrictions of the Mac App Store and then abandon the dysfunctional virtual marketplace, then you know Apple have pushed them beyond the edge. No company would just decide to leave the MAS unless the situation is hurting them significantly and holding them back. And unfortunately, there are almost no words to describe how bad the MAS has been for the ecosystem and innovation on the platform. [2]You also get ridiculous stuff like Intuit because of the limitations [4].Even if Apple fixes the Mac App Store one day, which is highly unlikely given that in 5 years they have done absolutely nothing, developers have been burned once and will be skeptical. You know, the whole \"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\".When people say that everything is fine and dandy with the MAS, they seem to be misguided - no one is asking Apple to make everyone a millionare. Developers are asking for Apple not to force simplistic business models and allow companies to have the ability to choose what works for them.I used to be hopeful for years but no more. I have zero faith that Apple will listen to indies and solve their problem, they've got no leverage. And that's a real pity. Instead of pairing high quality hardware with high quality software, we have a platform encouraging predatory tactics and milking of customers. A truly sad situation. And that's a real shame because the platform I love and have invested a decade in deserves better. It might even be too late - the damage to developers has been enormous.[1] http://blog.helftone.com/mac-app-store-the-subtle-exodus/[2] http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/12/no-one-minding-the-store/[3] http://dancounsell.typed.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-sto...[4] http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from...[5] https://twitter.com/tmaes/status/657213874970763267[6] https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/669321851793879040",

It launches, I go to click on something and an ad for a game pops up in a separate window blocking the interface.4) It shows me ads for games that don't work on any system I've ever used Steam on.5) Support from Valve is non-existent. If you try to get support for a game, they will by default tell you it's the game vendor's fault, even before figuring out what the problem is. If you try to use their support forums, you are required to use a different login and password than the one you use for the store. WTF? Why would they ever do that?The list goes on.

In this case I think the parent comment combined with the GP comment capture the issue, when the App Store concept is implemented poorly, it negatively effects user experience, vendor experience, and customer satisfaction. When it is done well, it enhances those things.The key is that Apple has not pulled off a successful App Store concept for MacOS yet, and worse they haven't really internalized some of the things that make App Stores \"good\" or \"bad\". As a result, people are leaving.The response though will be even more interesting, either Apple can give application delivery the focus it needs and become the best in class example, or they can continue to languish, or worse they mandate by fiat use of feature which negatively impacts the brand.App Stores try to be too many things at once. They started off as discovery, distribution, and payment processors. They have evolved into sort of microservice delivery applications. When the sandbox + App starts looking like a container instance running a unikernel, you've really supplanted the OS entirely. But that model doesn't work well for what many people think of as \"productivity\" apps.I hope Apple chooses to give this problem the focus it needs.

The reality I think is that it's being pushed a little and pulled a lot by the mainstream of the market.By mainstream I mean non-tech-savvy users, non-hackers. That's most people. I can completely understand how wonderful a \"managed platform\" like iOS is to a non-technical user. No malware! (Or at least greatly reduced risk of it.) No OS rot! No IT! No complicated system administration! It's like replacing a hand-cranked car by one with electronic ignition and an engine that doesn't constantly need retuning.For most people \"freedom\" means the freedom to get crapware and malware, spend hours that you can't spare futzing with your computer and getting nothing done, and have to reinstall your OS every year because it gets borked. Non-hackers hate platforms like that with a passion that it's difficult to understand. I often try to communicate it by comparing it to cars: how would you feel if you had to tune your engine every week, manually inspect every tank of gas for adulterants, and periodically stop your car to perform an inspection as you drive down the highway?At the same time, the car analogy is deeply imperfect. In the computing world when you trade Windows or OS X for iOS you're giving up a lot of capability and a lot of freedom. Tech-savvy and professional users either don't want to give that up or as is the case with developers can't give it up.But the problem is that non-tech-savvy users are most of the market, especially as computing becomes more and more mainstream, and most of the market is the market for a large company like Apple. Edges of markets don't matter. As such, I see the majority opinion of the market pulling things away from open platforms and rich capability and toward a managed, simplified, jailed, iOS-like future.I think there's a real risk that the professional will be left with a choice between the awful UX offered by pure OSS and being forced to adapt to iOS or similar platforms.Hey, maybe it'll prod the OSS folks into really taking UX seriously.Yeah.I'm not encouraged by what I see there nor by the combative/ultra-defensive attitude you get in those circles if you bring up this topic. One camp will insist that the latest Linux desktop or Ubuntu phone or whatever is great and is totally comparable to iOS and OSX and call you an idiot (and worse) for daring to think otherwise, and the other camp will just call you an idiot for \"needing\" UX or even a GUI at all because \"real men\" blah blah blah and why don't you read e-mail in emacs? I used to wade into those debates from time to time, but I stopped after I wrote a blog post (years ago) about Linux usability with some ideas about how to improve UI/UX development on Linux and the responses were full of insults I hadn't heard since Jr. High... not to mention one DDOS attack against the server.",

Those same things exist on iOS, but I keep hearing people say the MAS is somehow worse. From Apple's perspective, the sandbox limits are arguably justified by a desire to provide greater security and privacy controls. The review process is basically a consequence of that same goal - though of course, review time could be greatly reduced.It sounds like the core issue for people is sandboxing. But what specifically about sandboxing is the issue? Are the sandbox limits really too restrictive for most apps (I guess new APIs/permissions could improve that with time), or are there just a lot of developers who prefer not to rework their apps to deal with the sandbox restrictions? Or is the very idea of sandboxing the problem (or perhaps the default security setting for allowed app installation)?As long as apps can be distributed outside the MAS, I guess I don't really understand the problem.

And MAS support does give refunds, albeit at their discretion - but that's how much of the retail world already operates. Many developers would consider that an added convenience.Again, my contention is not that the MAS is perfect, but to say that we're worse off for having it is hard to fathom. If the inconveniences really outweigh the conveniences, then distribute your app outside the MAS. Problem solved.I can understand similar complaints about the iOS App Store since there are no alternatives (outside of jailbreaking) for native app distribution, but in this case it's just an option.

So sure you can look elsewhere but Apple is fighting against you.30% cut is very high as well. I think existing payment systems for shareware apps were 5% or less. What do you get for your 30%? Support? No. Discovery? Not really. File Hosting? Ok, maybe but is that worth 30%? Easy upgrade and install. That's about it but usually that would be mostly handled by a free library.",

I can understand it with the iOS to some degree. At least there they are constantly providing new features and hardware changes to help apps keep being innovative.To give an example of the Sandbox issue.We are using AppleScript for some of our logic in the background. Because of the Sandbox every time AS is used a little gear pops up in the top menu of OSX.This started with Yosemite. But worse than that. The implimentation of this security measure was completely sloppy. The gear didn't just appear it also rearranged the top bar icons and I of course got a horde of users complaining. We tried many things to solve this but had to finally give up and just offer MAS users to switch to our non-MAS version.You would think that at least people would be able to turn off such a thing with apps they knew were ok. But no.Furthermore reviews can really make you or break you. For a long time we had good reviews because I spent a lot of time making sure people understood why the spinning gear was there. But after a while one star reviews started appearing and we had no way of mitigating that or contact the user and tell them they could switch to the non MAS app if they had that issue.And so I finally realized that if you want to actually do any innovation with your apps and built a proper business MAS is not for you.I am beginning to wonder if there is room for an alternate App Store based on the the Developer Certificate or some security setup open sourced.Anyway. My next product wont even be going on the MAS. It's simply not worth it. It's just a distribution channel for Apple to show their latest features (the only way you get featured)",

Of course there's other issues like what happens when Paddle or Devmate go belly up ande stop processing license activations. But still it takes only a weekend to get it to work and once you get it to run it just works.The real problem though is that the Mac software ecosystem outside the MAS is dead. No user goes to those huge software directory websites anymore (my traffic from MacUpdate & co. is almost zero). (Funnily enough before the MAS went live Apple had a list of OS X software. It was a great source of high quality traffic back then. But it wen't offline with the introduction of the MAS).The only way to get your app infront of users is via SEO (which means that you take your eggs from the MAS basket and put them all into the Google basket) or by spending loads of money on PPC ads which won't give you a positive ROI because $39 is now considered hugely expensive for software.Social media, blog posts, etc. are all nice in theory but won't convert to paying users. You made a funny cat picture that went viral and sends thousands of reddit users to your website? Great, but no one will download your app. They just want the cat picture.The same goes for paying $10k for a blog post over at daringfireball. People will visit your website but won't download.Buying ads directly on blogs, forums or twitter/facebook? No one cares for those. You will just lose money.Marketing your own software got really hard nowadays and if you're not one of the \"famous\" developers removing your app from the Mac App Store just means that you will lose most of your revenue.Great for Sketch that they can pull it off.

Just make it a real native app and rewrite it.\"Native app is not really a black and white concept when you're talking about an app that mainly just interprets and displays live data it receives. If it's not html, then it's going to be xml/json/some other markup with a custom presentation layer on top. Why would that be better? In this case I just don't think you can point the finger at webview vs native as a problem or a solution. Yes, the app may be crap, but that seems mostly unrelated to the technology used to build it. I'm guessing it's more a factor of lack of resources, team member quality, management, or inter-departmental communication issues in a large corporation.",

Apple clearly have a lot of talent who know Cocoa and Obj-C inside and out. Chances are their current devs prioritise those kinds of apps over the kinds you might see Google or FB prioritise. Heck look at how long it took FB to come out with a decent iOS app. Their first mobile version was HTML with a native wrapper. It took FB time to build the talent base to do a decent app (believe they even had to hire Loren Brichter to consult to help them with it!).Every company has its specialities. Apple is getting better but as their data loss issues with Photos and Apple Music, as well as their problems with MobileMe show they are clearly finding it hard getting web devs who can build what they need fast enough. It'll take them time - they have enough cash to get there but they sure are alienating a lot of users and devs with these issues.",

One fine day, I try to launch 1P and i get an error box saying I need to authorize the app on the computer using my iTunes ! Rats now this is a deadlock ! Possible solutions are use the same password for 1Password vault and iTunes or buy iPassword from agilebits directly. I will go the latter route in future.",

    "text": "In addition to those mentioned here in the comments already, another problem that publishing through the Mac App Store is how buggy OS X\u2019s sandboxing can be. I don\u2019t know if the problem still exists under 10.11 (I bet it does but I haven\u2019t checked), but one bug that I\u2019ve hit consistently has to do with file open/save dialogs.Open/save dialogs in sandboxed apps aren\u2019t opened directly. Instead, requests are handled by the privileged powerboxd helper daemon, which then passes back user choices to the sandboxed app. This sounds great in theory, but something that happens somewhat frequently is that some part of powerboxd\u2019s dialog initialization silently fails and doesn\u2019t open a dialog, leaving the user confused as to why his requested open dialog didn\u2019t open. Worse, when it happens, it can happen several times in a row, meaning the user can try several times and not get any kind of feedback whatsoever.It\u2019s been a known issue since at least 10.7 and last I checked (10.10) it still hadn\u2019t been fixed. This is a showstopping bug for many kinds of apps but it\u2019s simply been ignored.I\u2019ve been wanting to move off of the MAS but as a one-man shop, writing in serial code support, trial mode, and registration is daunting, not to mention getting old users set up with a new license. I might just delay the move away from MAS until the next major release.",
