For jsfiddle I have to hit RUN every time I edit HTML &#x2F; CSS.Long time ago, when I was accumulating my stack overflow reputation, I used to do demos with jsfiddle. Back then I remembered how I switched to jsbin, which was so much faster and has a console.log panel which makes it even superior ( not to mention it&#x27;s open source ).Anyway jsfiddle has it&#x27;s place in the history and kudos for the team that supports it.",
