That data used to be directly available to and collected by HitTail, since search terms were in the referring URLs of every visit to the site coming from a search engine.Now that Google virtually never includes search terms in referring URLs, the only way HitTail can get the data it needs is via Google's APIs. Google can change the API, remove the API, or change the terms of use, and HitTail's SOL. Already they only have access to a subset of search data the API makes available, rather than all long-tail keywords, which they had a few years ago.Will Google remain friendly to tools like this in the future?

Meaning it would take you 4/5/6/7 years.Also, if you then reinvest that $3m in more traditional assets (stocks/bonds/property/alternatives), you can earn 5-10% on that capital ($150-300k per year), WHILE working on something new.

Then you declare a dividend, and pay a dividend tax. That'll be 25-30%, so you'd be left with \u00a3800k - 30% = \u00a3560k in pocket.To earn \u00a33m (in pocket), you would have to generate approx. \u00a35.25m in pretax corporate profit.Whereas with a share sale, you will be taxed at 10%, meaning you're left with \u00a32.7m (if you sell for \u00a33m).

Acquiring an app with product/market fit puts you ~18 months ahead of starting from scratch. Like most founders, I'm not a very patient person. I'm now working on GetDrip.com, and it took us a long time to hit p/m fit. The slog to get there is the worst part of launching a product, IMO.2. Financially, this was a game changer for me. During the course of my tenure with HitTail, revenue + the sale prices funded multiple angel investments, the budget for building and launching Drip, and many other things I would not have been able to afford previously.3. The acquisition and revamp were also game changing for me in terms of what I was able to learn, the content I was able to produce from it (multiple MicroConf talks). Both are important to me.Even without the sale, the learnings and financial rewards were still a major success for me.>>Will you be going through the trash to find your next treasure?I've already started my next one, GetDrip.com. I built it from scratch with a co-founder, and I can't count the times I've said \"I'm never going to build from scratch again!\"I try not to say \"never,\" but if I could choose build or buy I would buy.
