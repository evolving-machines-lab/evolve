Several reasons:1. Acquiring an app with product/market fit puts you ~18 months ahead of starting from scratch. Like most founders, I'm not a very patient person. I'm now working on GetDrip.com, and it took us a long time to hit p/m fit. The slog to get there is the worst part of launching a product, IMO.2. Financially, this was a game changer for me. During the course of my tenure with HitTail, revenue + the sale prices funded multiple angel investments, the budget for building and launching Drip, and many other things I would not have been able to afford previously.3. The acquisition and revamp were also game changing for me in terms of what I was able to learn, the content I was able to produce from it (multiple MicroConf talks). Both are important to me.Even without the sale, the learnings and financial rewards were still a major success for me.>>Will you be going through the trash to find your next treasure?I've already started my next one, GetDrip.com. I built it from scratch with a co-founder, and I can't count the times I've said \\\"I'm never going to build from scratch again!\\\"I try not to say \\\"never,\\\" but if I could choose build or buy I would buy.
