By Karen Weise | December 1, 2015 Photographs by Nathaneal Turner From It seemed too good to be true. On April\u00c2 13, with reporters from the New York Times and NBC News hovering nearby, Dan Price, the young chief executive officer of Gravity Payments , a Seattle-based credit card processing company, told his staff he was raising their minimum salary to $70,000 a year. Some employees would see their wages double. There was more: He planned to cut his own $1.1\u00c2 million compensation to help cover the cost. The idea came to him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d later tell the media , after talking to a friend who earned less than he did. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d read about a study showing that extra income improves the happiness of people who earn less than about $75,000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about making money; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about making a difference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Price told the Today Show , one of two dozen TV interviews he did in the days following the announcement. Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story rocketed around the world, a capitalist fairy tale to counter growing inequality. With his tousled long hair and dark brown eyes, Price combined Brad Pitt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smolder and Boo Boo Bear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aw-shucks demeanor to become an articulate and attractive messenger. Rush Limbaugh denounced him as a socialist. Jesse Ventura christened him Robin Hood. In late summer, the New York Times ran a longer piece on Price, now 31, showing that raising wages wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so simple. Job applicants had overwhelmed his company, and two employees quit, saying the increase wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair to higher earners. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPotentially the worst blow of all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Times wrote, was that about two weeks after the announcement, Price was sued by his older brother Lucas, who owns about 30\u00c2 percent of Gravity, alleging Price paid himself too much in the first place. Price insinuated that his brother may have sued in reaction to the generous pay increase. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the decision to pay everyone a living wage is controversial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the Seattle Times , which first reported the lawsuit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI deeply regret the rift this has caused in my relationship with my brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An expensive lawsuit, filed possibly in response to his kind act, made Price seem more of an underdog. When I met him at Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters in mid-October, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even supposed to be in Seattle. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been scheduled to join Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards and General David Petraeus on a panel titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeading Under Pressure\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the Chicago Ideas Week festival. But Price had canceled at the last minute, saying he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hit a wall of exhaustion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just standing in for a bunch of other people doing great stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me the responsibility is to be the best spokesperson I can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As we talked about his wild six months, I brought up the lawsuit, asking if Price thought Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending on the raises triggered his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suit, as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d implied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he slowly shrugged, looking right at me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe quote in the Seattle Times from his attorney was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only because of that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u009d He twisted his beard between two fingers, contemplating the statement by Lucas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney, Greg Hollon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat one singular quote in the paper is the only information I have about if they were connected or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poignant story, one that I almost wrote. Until I realized Price knew more than he was letting on. The lawsuit couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been prompted by the pay raise\u00e2\u0080\u0094if anything, it may have been the other way around. And his salary before the big announcement was unusually high. As I read through the court record and media reports, I began to see how Price was writing his own origin myth one interview at a time. With what he says is a $500,000 book deal, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solidifying his place as the next do-gooder businessman, joining the CEOs of bigger companies, such as Zappos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tony Hsieh and Whole Foods Market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s John Mackey. In the process, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surely become the only credit card processing executive to be feted by Esquire , courted by literary agents, and swooned at by women on social media who declared him \u00e2\u0080\u009c yum .\u00e2\u0080\u009d But how it all happened is a little more complicated. Gravity staffers plank during meetings to encourage each other to speak quickly. Photographer: Nathaneal Turner for Bloomberg Businessweek The day-to-day work at Gravity Payments is pretty unglamorous. Gravity is a middleman between merchants and payment networks, namely Visa and MasterCard, which in turn connect to banks that issue credit cards. If you use a credit card to pay for a Habanero Soft Chicken Burrito at a Taco Time in Seattle, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gravity that helps move $6.29 from your bank to the restaurant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, keeping a sliver for its service along the way. As Price tells it, he started thinking about credit cards when his middle school band, Straightforword, was gigging around Idaho. He grew up in a religious family outside Boise, the fourth of six kids. The \u00e2\u0080\u009c teenage rock star ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as his speaking-circuit agent now bills him, frequently performed at a local coffee shop and got to know the owner. Price says she complained about how much she had to pay for credit card processing and inadvertently taught him about swipe fees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe let us do a show and gave us 100\u00c2 percent of the door, but when someone wanted to pay their entrance with a credit card, we had to pay the fee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. About that time, Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father began consulting for the credit card industry. Price learned the ropes from his dad and helped businesses negotiate with processing vendors. In 2003, Price started college in Seattle, and he and Lucas founded Gravity the next year. The brothers initially split the company evenly. In 2005, at 21, Price married Kristie Lewellyn, and the next year he became Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO. Gravity works to keep merchants happy with low prices and good service. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expensive, but acquiring new clients can be even more so. Gravity says it historically has lost only about 9\u00c2 percent of its customers a year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTypically, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than 30\u00c2 percent attrition per year in our industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Price says. Not quite: A 2012 study for Discover Financial Services found the rate averages 16\u00c2 percent, and other sources indicate attrition rates well below 30 percent. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, consumers cut their spending, and about 20\u00c2 percent of Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business disappeared within weeks, Price says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt changed us from being mildly profitable to where we were losing money every month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called a company meeting, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098In seven months we will be out of business, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold expenses and get into the black,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalls. It worked. In 2012, Price began raising staff pay in steps. Each raise, he says, brought a surge in profit. In February 2012, he and Lewellyn divorced, \u00e2\u0080\u009camicably,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the New York Times and Inc. wrote. Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own pay grew rapidly. In 2011 he was making \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably $50,000 a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer. In 2012 his compensation jumped to $1\u00c2 million, he says. That August, records show, he paid cash for a $900,000 house with a pool\u00e2\u0080\u0094a rarity in Seattle. In 2013, Price says, Gravity hired compensation consultant Towers Watson to look at his salary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Towers Watson recommendation allowed for significant raises over the $1.1\u00c2 million, but I elected to not raise my pay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. Hollon, Lucas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney, says Price is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmischaracterizing\u00e2\u0080\u009d the findings. When Price made his $70,000 announcement, he told his staff, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy pay is set based on market rates and kinda what it would take to replace me. And because of this growing inequality, as a CEO that amount is really, really high. I make, uh, you know, a crazy, uh, my compensation is really, really high.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never given myself a raise without unanimous, full board approval\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whether judged by gross or net revenue, Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay was atypical for a company its size. Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finances aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t public, but Price says gross revenue was $150\u00c2 million in 2014 and will rise to an estimated $200\u00c2 million in 2015. But Gravity doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to keep the bulk of that revenue; it must automatically pass most of it on to credit card networks and issuers. The amount the company retains\u00e2\u0080\u0094net revenue, which Price calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably a more relevant figure\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094was $16\u00c2 million in 2014, he says. Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2014 profit was $2.2\u00c2 million, Price adds. At private companies with sales like Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total revenue, salary and bonus for the top quartile of CEOs is $710,000, according to Chief Executive magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual compensation survey . At companies with sales like Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net revenue, the top quartile pay falls to about $373,000. At companies with a similar number of employees as Gravity, the top quartile of CEOs makes $470,000 in salary and bonus. The CEO of JetPay, a publicly traded competitor that processes a similar volume as Gravity, received $355,000 in 2014. After meeting Price and researching the figures, I called to ask if he thought his $1.1\u00c2 million pay was fair, given those benchmarks. He replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI appreciate you asking the question. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to answer any other questions you might have. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m way over time, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of people waiting for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When we spoke later, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never given myself a raise without unanimous, full board approval.\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0089That means we both voted the same way. Lucas Price and Daniel Price, the two board members.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hollon says that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinaccurate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that Price \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaid himself excessive compensation for a number of years\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0089over Lucas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Photographer: Nathaneal Turner for Bloomberg Businessweek As he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recounted over and over, Price says his aha moment about pay came in late March, on a hike with his friend. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI realized that there were people I was working with\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I said I valued as partners, I said I really want to invest in\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they were making less than her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told The Daily Show \u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trevor Noah. Price says he thought back to a 2010 paper by Nobel prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, who found that people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional well-being improves as their earnings rise, until their pay reaches about $75,000 a year. Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hiking friend, Valerie Molina, remembers their exchange. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDan said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to pay all my employees minimum $70,000,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u009d Molina said in an e-mail. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure exactly how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do it, I need to run the numbers, but I am. Is that crazy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gravity had about 120 employees, and they earned a little less than $50,000 on average. He found it would cost about $1.8\u00c2 million to increase wages to $70,000 in steps over three years. Cutting his own pay would cover much of that, and if the wage hikes made his staff more productive, he figured, the whole move just might work. Price had gotten publicity for a previous pay increase, telling the Seattle Times in 2013 that he was raising salaries 2\u00c2 percent to make up for a federal hike in the employee payroll tax. Ryan Pirkle, who runs Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications, says with the bigger 2014 raise, Price told him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want the right people to tell the right story. I want exclusivity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why they invited the New York Times and NBC News to the announcement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just doing the math, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u009d Price told me. He figured he could get as many as 700 new customers from the publicity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat could pay for 10\u00c2 percent of this crazy thing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing.\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0089Of course, it became about something way bigger than that in hindsight, but at the time I was thinking so tactically.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By 3 a.m. the morning after the announcement, Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone was buzzing. The Today Show wanted him the next morning, as did Good Morning America . He hopped a plane to New York. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did something like 25 live TV interviews in three days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are really passionate about reforming credit card processing. This seemed like an opportunity\u00e2\u0080\u0094we could have a really big impact doing that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fox News pilloried him. Actor Russell Brand, in a laudatory YouTube video, joked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to ignore the fact that Dan Price looks a lot like Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Price says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been courted by TV producers including Ryan Seacrest and Mark Burnett, who created Survivor and The Apprentice . A spokesman for Seacrest says he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not recall ever speaking with Mr. Price\u00e2\u0080\u009d; Burnett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press representatives didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return requests for comment. Price signed with the talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment and now charges as much as $20,000 per speech, Pirkle says. When I visited Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office in October, Price told his team that the company was getting free booth space at Inc. magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual conference, in addition to a speaking fee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn terms of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying us for a one-hour talk, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at well over $100,000,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Inc. put him on its November cover. (Inc. didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to requests for comment.) Price told me the hoopla has him feeling torn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis might sound weird, because I do a lot of stuff, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sick of attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just feels like a lot of investment of yourself, you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He recalled when he was on the cover of Entrepreneur magazine last December and the relief he felt when the next issue went on sale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was so happy when they changed issues and I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on the cover anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in the airport a lot, and I was just so happy to not see myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet for all the relief, Price and his team asked six times if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be on Bloomberg Businessweek \u00e2\u0080\u0099s cover. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just so sick of attention ... It just feels like a lot of investment of yourself\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two weeks after returning from the April media blitzkrieg in New York, Price told me, he was settling in at home to finally unwind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going to watch my first soccer game since this had all happened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy doorbell rang, and there was a legal courier. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you Dan Price?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u009d Price said he was served with Lucas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawsuit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was shocked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe soccer game got turned off pretty quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was during this recounting that Price told me how the comment from Lucas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer in the Seattle Times was the \u00e2\u0080\u009conly information I have about if they were connected or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The possible retaliatory nature of the suit only adds to the drama of Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wage hike. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is all speculation on my part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pirkle said in late September, before explaining how, as minority shareholder, Lucas gets paid dividends from Gravity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose profits are obsolete when you raise the wages.",

Coordinating among multiple people plus the back and forth iterative process that editing generates adds a lot of overhead to the writing process. Self editing is much faster (and therefore cheaper), but you get blind to errors that would jump out at someone else, and so errors slip through much more readily. Plus, other people are capable of challenging your assumptions in a way that you just aren't capable of since you aren't even always aware of your own assumptions.
