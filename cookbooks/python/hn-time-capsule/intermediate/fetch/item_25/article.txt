The CEO Paying Everyone $70,000 Salaries Has Something to Hide Bloomberg the Company & its Products Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Bloomberg Terminal Request a Demo The CEO Paying Everyone $70,000 Salaries Has Something to Hide Inside the viral story of Gravity CEO Dan Price. By Karen Weise | December 1, 2015 Photographs by Nathaneal Turner From It seemed too good to be true. On AprilÂ 13, with reporters from the New York Times and NBC News hovering nearby, Dan Price, the young chief executive officer of Gravity Payments , a Seattle-based credit card processing company, told his staff he was raising their minimum salary to $70,000 a year. Some employees would see their wages double. There was more: He planned to cut his own $1.1Â million compensation to help cover the cost. The idea came to him, heâd later tell the media , after talking to a friend who earned less than he did. Heâd read about a study showing that extra income improves the happiness of people who earn less than about $75,000. âItâs not about making money; itâs about making a difference,â Price told the Today Show , one of two dozen TV interviews he did in the days following the announcement. Priceâs story rocketed around the world, a capitalist fairy tale to counter growing inequality. With his tousled long hair and dark brown eyes, Price combined Brad Pittâs smolder and Boo Boo Bearâs aw-shucks demeanor to become an articulate and attractive messenger. Rush Limbaugh denounced him as a socialist. Jesse Ventura christened him Robin Hood. In late summer, the New York Times ran a longer piece on Price, now 31, showing that raising wages wasnât so simple. Job applicants had overwhelmed his company, and two employees quit, saying the increase wasnât fair to higher earners. âPotentially the worst blow of all,â the Times wrote, was that about two weeks after the announcement, Price was sued by his older brother Lucas, who owns about 30Â percent of Gravity, alleging Price paid himself too much in the first place. Price insinuated that his brother may have sued in reaction to the generous pay increase. âI know the decision to pay everyone a living wage is controversial,â he told the Seattle Times , which first reported the lawsuit. âI deeply regret the rift this has caused in my relationship with my brother.â An expensive lawsuit, filed possibly in response to his kind act, made Price seem more of an underdog. When I met him at Gravityâs headquarters in mid-October, he wasnât even supposed to be in Seattle. Heâd been scheduled to join Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards and General David Petraeus on a panel titled âLeading Under Pressureâ at the Chicago Ideas Week festival. But Price had canceled at the last minute, saying heâd hit a wall of exhaustion. âI think Iâm just standing in for a bunch of other people doing great stuff,â he said. âTo me the responsibility is to be the best spokesperson I can.â As we talked about his wild six months, I brought up the lawsuit, asking if Price thought Gravityâs spending on the raises triggered his brotherâs suit, as heâd implied. âI have no idea,â he slowly shrugged, looking right at me. âThe quote in the Seattle Times from his attorney was, âIt wasnât only because of that.âââ He twisted his beard between two fingers, contemplating the statement by Lucasâs attorney, Greg Hollon. âThat one singular quote in the paper is the only information I have about if they were connected or not.â Itâs a poignant story, one that I almost wrote. Until I realized Price knew more than he was letting on. The lawsuit couldnât have been prompted by the pay raiseâif anything, it may have been the other way around. And his salary before the big announcement was unusually high. As I read through the court record and media reports, I began to see how Price was writing his own origin myth one interview at a time. With what he says is a $500,000 book deal, heâs solidifying his place as the next do-gooder businessman, joining the CEOs of bigger companies, such as Zapposâs Tony Hsieh and Whole Foods Marketâs John Mackey. In the process, heâs surely become the only credit card processing executive to be feted by Esquire , courted by literary agents, and swooned at by women on social media who declared him â yum .â But how it all happened is a little more complicated. Gravity staffers plank during meetings to encourage each other to speak quickly. Photographer: Nathaneal Turner for Bloomberg Businessweek The day-to-day work at Gravity Payments is pretty unglamorous. Gravity is a middleman between merchants and payment networks, namely Visa and MasterCard, which in turn connect to banks that issue credit cards. If you use a credit card to pay for a Habanero Soft Chicken Burrito at a Taco Time in Seattle, itâs Gravity that helps move $6.29 from your bank to the restaurantâs, keeping a sliver for its service along the way. As Price tells it, he started thinking about credit cards when his middle school band, Straightforword, was gigging around Idaho. He grew up in a religious family outside Boise, the fourth of six kids. The â teenage rock star ,â as his speaking-circuit agent now bills him, frequently performed at a local coffee shop and got to know the owner. Price says she complained about how much she had to pay for credit card processing and inadvertently taught him about swipe fees. âShe let us do a show and gave us 100Â percent of the door, but when someone wanted to pay their entrance with a credit card, we had to pay the fee,â he says. About that time, Priceâs father began consulting for the credit card industry. Price learned the ropes from his dad and helped businesses negotiate with processing vendors. In 2003, Price started college in Seattle, and he and Lucas founded Gravity the next year. The brothers initially split the company evenly. In 2005, at 21, Price married Kristie Lewellyn, and the next year he became Gravityâs CEO. Gravity works to keep merchants happy with low prices and good service. Thatâs expensive, but acquiring new clients can be even more so. Gravity says it historically has lost only about 9Â percent of its customers a year. âTypically, thereâs more than 30Â percent attrition per year in our industry,â Price says. Not quite: A 2012 study for Discover Financial Services found the rate averages 16Â percent, and other sources indicate attrition rates well below 30 percent. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, consumers cut their spending, and about 20Â percent of Gravityâs business disappeared within weeks, Price says. âIt changed us from being mildly profitable to where we were losing money every month.â He called a company meeting, and âI said, âIn seven months we will be out of business, so letâs hold expenses and get into the black,âââ he recalls. It worked. In 2012, Price began raising staff pay in steps. Each raise, he says, brought a surge in profit. In February 2012, he and Lewellyn divorced, âamicably,â the New York Times and Inc. wrote. Priceâs own pay grew rapidly. In 2011 he was making âprobably $50,000 a year,â he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer. In 2012 his compensation jumped to $1Â million, he says. That August, records show, he paid cash for a $900,000 house with a poolâa rarity in Seattle. In 2013, Price says, Gravity hired compensation consultant Towers Watson to look at his salary. âThe Towers Watson recommendation allowed for significant raises over the $1.1Â million, but I elected to not raise my pay,â he says. Hollon, Lucasâs attorney, says Price is âmischaracterizingâ the findings. When Price made his $70,000 announcement, he told his staff, âMy pay is set based on market rates and kinda what it would take to replace me. And because of this growing inequality, as a CEO that amount is really, really high. I make, uh, you know, a crazy, uh, my compensation is really, really high.â âI have never given myself a raise without unanimous, full board approvalâ Whether judged by gross or net revenue, Priceâs pay was atypical for a company its size. Gravityâs finances arenât public, but Price says gross revenue was $150Â million in 2014 and will rise to an estimated $200Â million in 2015. But Gravity doesnât get to keep the bulk of that revenue; it must automatically pass most of it on to credit card networks and issuers. The amount the company retainsânet revenue, which Price calls âprobably a more relevant figureââwas $16Â million in 2014, he says. Gravityâs 2014 profit was $2.2Â million, Price adds. At private companies with sales like Gravityâs total revenue, salary and bonus for the top quartile of CEOs is $710,000, according to Chief Executive magazineâs annual compensation survey . At companies with sales like Gravityâs net revenue, the top quartile pay falls to about $373,000. At companies with a similar number of employees as Gravity, the top quartile of CEOs makes $470,000 in salary and bonus. The CEO of JetPay, a publicly traded competitor that processes a similar volume as Gravity, received $355,000 in 2014. After meeting Price and researching the figures, I called to ask if he thought his $1.1Â million pay was fair, given those benchmarks. He replied: âI appreciate you asking the question. Iâm happy to answer any other questions you might have. Iâm way over time, and thereâs a bunch of people waiting for me.â When we spoke later, he said, âI have never given myself a raise without unanimous, full board approval.ââ¦âThat means we both voted the same way. Lucas Price and Daniel Price, the two board members.â Hollon says thatâs âinaccurateâ and that Price âpaid himself excessive compensation for a number of yearsââ¦âover Lucasâs objections.â Photographer: Nathaneal Turner for Bloomberg Businessweek As heâs recounted over and over, Price says his aha moment about pay came in late March, on a hike with his friend. âI realized that there were people I was working withâthat I said I valued as partners, I said I really want to invest inâand they were making less than her,â he told The Daily Show âs Trevor Noah. Price says he thought back to a 2010 paper by Nobel prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, who found that peopleâs emotional well-being improves as their earnings rise, until their pay reaches about $75,000 a year. Priceâs hiking friend, Valerie Molina, remembers their exchange. âDan said, âIâm going to pay all my employees minimum $70,000,âââ Molina said in an e-mail. âââIâm not sure exactly how Iâm going to do it, I need to run the numbers, but I am. Is that crazy?âââ Gravity had about 120 employees, and they earned a little less than $50,000 on average. He found it would cost about $1.8Â million to increase wages to $70,000 in steps over three years. Cutting his own pay would cover much of that, and if the wage hikes made his staff more productive, he figured, the whole move just might work. Price had gotten publicity for a previous pay increase, telling the Seattle Times in 2013 that he was raising salaries 2Â percent to make up for a federal hike in the employee payroll tax. Ryan Pirkle, who runs Gravityâs communications, says with the bigger 2014 raise, Price told him, âI want the right people to tell the right story. I want exclusivity.â Thatâs why they invited the New York Times and NBC News to the announcement. âIâm just doing the math, and Iâm like, âWow,âââ Price told me. He figured he could get as many as 700 new customers from the publicity. âThat could pay for 10Â percent of this crazy thing that Iâm doing.ââ¦âOf course, it became about something way bigger than that in hindsight, but at the time I was thinking so tactically.â By 3 a.m. the morning after the announcement, Priceâs phone was buzzing. The Today Show wanted him the next morning, as did Good Morning America . He hopped a plane to New York. âI did something like 25 live TV interviews in three days,â he says. âWe are really passionate about reforming credit card processing. This seemed like an opportunityâwe could have a really big impact doing that.â Fox News pilloried him. Actor Russell Brand, in a laudatory YouTube video, joked, âItâs difficult to ignore the fact that Dan Price looks a lot like Jesus.â Price says heâs been courted by TV producers including Ryan Seacrest and Mark Burnett, who created Survivor and The Apprentice . A spokesman for Seacrest says he âdoes not recall ever speaking with Mr. Priceâ; Burnettâs press representatives didnât return requests for comment. Price signed with the talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment and now charges as much as $20,000 per speech, Pirkle says. When I visited Gravityâs office in October, Price told his team that the company was getting free booth space at Inc. magazineâs annual conference, in addition to a speaking fee. âIn terms of what theyâre paying us for a one-hour talk, weâre looking at well over $100,000,â he said. Inc. put him on its November cover. (Inc. didnât respond to requests for comment.) Price told me the hoopla has him feeling torn. âThis might sound weird, because I do a lot of stuff, but Iâm so sick of attention,â he said. âIt just feels like a lot of investment of yourself, you know?â He recalled when he was on the cover of Entrepreneur magazine last December and the relief he felt when the next issue went on sale. âI was so happy when they changed issues and I wasnât on the cover anymore,â he said. âIâm in the airport a lot, and I was just so happy to not see myself.â Yet for all the relief, Price and his team asked six times if heâd be on Bloomberg Businessweek âs cover. âIâm just so sick of attention ... It just feels like a lot of investment of yourselfâ Two weeks after returning from the April media blitzkrieg in New York, Price told me, he was settling in at home to finally unwind. âI was going to watch my first soccer game since this had all happened,â he recalled. âMy doorbell rang, and there was a legal courier. âAre you Dan Price?â âYes.âââ Price said he was served with Lucasâs lawsuit. âI was shocked,â he said. âThe soccer game got turned off pretty quickly.â It was during this recounting that Price told me how the comment from Lucasâs lawyer in the Seattle Times was the âonly information I have about if they were connected or not.â The possible retaliatory nature of the suit only adds to the drama of Priceâs wage hike. âThis is all speculation on my part,â Pirkle said in late September, before explaining how, as minority shareholder, Lucas gets paid dividends from Gravityâs profits. âThose profits are obsolete when you raise the wages.
