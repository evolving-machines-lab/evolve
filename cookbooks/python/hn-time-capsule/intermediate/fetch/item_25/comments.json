It's really not so surprising given the way the news landscape has changed in the last couple decades. Editing is expensive[1]. The internet ripped the heart out of the print news business. Accordingly, editing has been cut back drastically pretty much across the board in response to increasingly tight budgets. [1] Much more expensive than one might assume without having experienced the process. Coordinating among multiple people plus the back and forth iterative process that editing generates adds a lot of overhead to the writing process. Self editing is much faster (and therefore cheaper), but you get blind to errors that would jump out at someone else, and so errors slip through much more readily. Plus, other people are capable of challenging your assumptions in a way that you just aren't capable of since you aren't even always aware of your own assumptions. Source: I've written informally at the margins for a reasonably, but not tremendously, high trafficked niche blog, and have participated a little in both edited and self-edited articles from both the writing and editing side. This was never industrial strength editing, so I imagine the cost to actual news outlets with higher standards is a lot higher than I have experienced.",

I haven't read her stuff, but I seem to recall this plot being closer to a re-enactment, based second hand descriptions of the books. The later games do a somewhat better job though. In that light, he is absolutely buying the loyalty of his employees, and being a private company, we really have no idea how sustainable the system really is. Worse, these things are path dependent.

Shortly he did that, a story broke that Dan was being sued by his brother Lucas, who was demanding that Dan buy his stake out. Dan and his spokespeople represented to the media that the suit was a reaction to the pay raise, which reduced profits for owners to pay employees. But it turns out that Dan was served for the lawsuit before the pay raise, and that Dan's legal response to the suit also precedes the raise. It does not seem likely that the lawsuit had anything to do with the raise. It is now plausible (but unproven) that the raise was a tactical reaction to the suit. Furthermore, Dan Price's ex-wife alleges that Dan was physically violent to her. And, Dan Price's own salary is anomalously high given the details of the company. That's pretty much it.",
