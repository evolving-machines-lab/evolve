A friction-less workflow can take you from feeling overwhelmed, unfocused, and unproductive to feeling calm, in control, and prepared to take on even the biggest projects.\nThe good news is, there are new methods being developed, tweaked, and shared all the time. There\u2019s bound to be a system out there that fits your unique personality and projects. But wading through the thousands of articles about different productivity systems can be a massive time commitment \u2014 time you could be using to actually get things done.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to do the legwork for you. We\u2019ve gathered the most powerful productivity methods and frameworks all in one convenient place. This post will give you a brief overview of the most popular and useful productivity methods, how each works, and what kind of person will find each useful. It\u2019s designed to help you get set up with your ideal workflow as quickly as possible so you can start reaping the productivity benefits right away.\nHow to get the most out of this\u00a0guide\nFirst, we broke down the time commitment needed to get started with each method, rated with a simple\nLow\n,\nMedium\n, or\nHigh\n.\nEager to begin a huge project but feel completely lost whenever you try to start? Start with a method rated\nMedium\nor\nHigh\n.\nUp against a hard deadline with a to-do list the length of California and a tendency to procrastinate under stress? Jump to the systems with a\nLow\nrating.\nWe\u2019ve also indicated which methods are more\nVisual\n,\nTactile\n, or\nAbstract\n\u2014 many are a combination. If you know which learning/work style you lean toward, you can skim through and jump to the methods that align best with your natural approach:\nVisual\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who prefers maps over written or verbal directions, you\u2019ll probably find the visual methods more satisfying.\nTactile\nIf you love the feeling of physically crossing items off a to-do list or you often find yourself strategizing by moving note cards around on the floor, you\u2019ll probably feel most comfortable with tactile methods.\nAbstract\nIf neither of those approaches sound like you \u2014 if you organize projects simply by writing it down or you strategize easily in your head with no physical or visual representation \u2014 you might find the abstract methods most useful. The upside of abstract methods is that they also tend to allow for more complexity in prioritizing and categorizing.\nAs you learn about the way that you work best, here are a few things to keep in\u00a0mind:\nThe goal is to actually get stuff done.\nWhile it\u2019s common for new workflow to take extra time upfront, they should become increasingly effortless over time. If you find that sticking to a certain productivity method is taking up a significant amount of time, energy, and mental bandwidth, it\u2019s probably not for you. That\u2019s ok. There are plenty of other options out there.\nYou\u2019re not married to one productivity method forever.\nYou may find that a given method is better suited to some of your projects, and not others. A method that used to work for you might become a burden to maintain later on, or you may need a more robust system to tackle a growing workload. Be flexible and don\u2019t be afraid to make a change.\nTo borrow a phrase from Pirates of the Caribbean,\nproductivity methods are more what you\u2019d call \u201cguidelines\u201d than actual rules.\nThe methods outlined below are great starting points, but they\u2019re infinitely more powerful when you mold them to fit your specific work style. Experiment with different methods and mix and match to find your ideal workflow.\nReady to find the right productivity method for you?

And that can be a good thing. Sometimes all you need to make progress is a way to see the status of your projects laid out simply in front of you.\nHere\u2019s how Kanban works: Using whatever medium you prefer (sticky notes or a whiteboard work well), split your projects into three categories: To Do, Doing, and Done. That\u2019s it.\nBut this simple system is more powerful than it seems.\nBy using a finite space for \u201cTo Do\u201d and \u201cDoing,\u201d you\u2019ll see how quickly those categories fill up. You get a constant, physical reminder when you need to concentrate on finishing your current projects before starting new ones. In addition, having all your work laid out in front of you helps you feel calm and in control of the big picture.\nWant to learn more?\nProductivity 101: How to Use Personal Kanban to Visualize Your Work\n(lifehacker.com)\npersonalkanban.com\nPersonal Kanban: Mapping Work | Navigating Life\n(book)\nEating Live Frogs: Do the Worst Thing\u00a0First\nImage credit to\nhellostripes.blogspot.com\nTime commitment to get started:\nLow\nType:\nAbstract\nPerfect for people who:\nTend to put off important items, resulting in missed deadlines or rushed work.\nWhat it does:\nHelps to avoid procrastination while ensuring that you make progress on the\nright\nthings.\nA lot of productivity systems and tools are all about getting started. They assume that as long as you\u2019re crossing\nsomething\noff your to-do list, you\u2019re being productive. But in reality, it can make a big difference which task you pick first.\nIf you put off your most important tasks until the very last second, you\u2019re not really improving your productivity on the things that matter. And, worse, you may find yourself missing deadlines or hurting your reputation by rushing through your most challenging work.\nThe term, \u201ceating the frog first,\u201d comes from that old well of ( delightfully snarky) wisdom, Mark Twain. He supposedly once said, \u201cEat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.\u201d\nTo get started, schedule your daily tasks from hardest to easiest. You\u2019ll get your most important, intimidating, anxiety-inducing tasks(aka your frog) done while your energy is high and your day will get progressively better. You\u2019re likely to find the overall quality of your work improves too.\nA huge part of learning to be truly productive is accepting that the impulse to procrastinate is inevitable. Learning to work around your own self-destructive impulses is key. As Brian Tracy puts it in his book\nEat that Frog: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time\n:\nEveryone procrastinates. The difference between high performers and low performers is largely determined by what they choose to procrastinate on.\nWant to know more?\n[Workflow Guide] Why You Should Eat Your Frog First and How To Do It\nBig Rocks First: Double your Productivity this Week\nMust, Should,\u00a0Want\nImage credit fabiocruz.com.br\nTime commitment to get started:\nMedium\nType:\nAbstract, visual\nPerfect for people who:\nNeed to prioritize tasks, but tend to go for lists over graphs.\nWhat it does:\nPrioritizes your tasks by urgency, ensures that you\u2019re accomplishing the right things.\nMust, Should, Want is all about figuring out what\u2019s critical today and what can wait. Write down everything you have to do and then identify each as a Must, a Should, or a Want\n.\nYour Must tasks are non-negotiable.\n\u201c\nPay rent\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s a Must if it\u2019s the first of the month.\nA Should is something you need to do, but it\u2019s not dire that it be done today. Answering certain emails may be a Should. It\u2019s important, but delaying it a day or two may not be a big deal, especially if you have a list of Musts due tomorrow.\nA Want is something you\u2019d like to do, but might not be practical or necessary at the moment. It can be put off for the future, if need be. Learning a new language is a great goal, but if it\u2019s a choice between getting eight hours of sleep every night and becoming conversational in Portuguese, you might not want to risk\nthe long-term effects of sleep deprivation\njust to learn a new (albeit, beautiful) language.\nA popular variation on this method, called MoSCoW, calls the \u201cWant\u201d category, \u201cCould,\u201d and adds another, \u201cWon\u2019t\u201d for those pesky items that always seem to wind up on your to-do lists, but might not be worth your time and energy in the end.\nWant to know more?\nPrioritize Your Day with MUST, SHOULD, COULD (Day 9 of 30 Days of Getting Results)\nThree Tasks You Should Do Every Day to Stay Happy and Productive\nMoscow Method\nThe SMART\u00a0Method\nImage credit to gcflearnfree.org\nTime commitment to get started:\nMedium\nType:\nAbstract\nPerfect for people who:\nAre in the early phases of a big project and need to strategize before jumping in.\nWhat it does:\nTurns big, abstract ideas and goals into concrete, actionable plans.\nThere have been many adaptations and adjustments to the SMART productivity method since it was introduced three decades ago. At its core, SMART is a way to take a big, pie-in-the-sky idea and figure out how to make it work in the real world by asking yourself a series of questions. SMART is an acronym that stands for: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Timely.\nLet\u2019s break it down.\nSpecific:\nMeaning the What \u2014 what is this project and what,\nspecifically,\ndo you want to accomplish?\nMeasurable:\nThese are the individual tasks and steps that add up to a complete project.\nAssignable:\nWho is going to do which step? Yes, this is another method that can work for teams, but don\u2019t toss out this step if you\u2019re working on a solo project. Chances are, if you\u2019re using SMART you have a big project, and nothing that big can be accomplished 100% on your own.\nIf you have small children, you might use this step to think through childcare options. If you\u2019re starting a business, you might reach out to a lawyer or financial planner. Every large undertaking requires some help along the way.\nClarifying how you\u2019ll get that help will make it easier to get your project started.\nRealistic:\nThis is the Debbie Downer of SMART. It encompasses all obstacles in your way, everything that could threaten your project. You can\u2019t overcome a problem until you understand it completely. By carefully considering the challenges ahead, you can start mulling over solutions before they even get a chance to trip you up.\nTimely:\nDeadlines. Deadlines are an important part of nearly every successful productivity strategy, and with good reason. Time constraints force us to be efficient. Come up with reasonable deadlines for each measureable task \u2014 ideally giving you more time than you think you\u2019ll need so you don\u2019t fall victim to the\nPlanning Fallacy\n.\nOverall, SMART is perfectly suited for thinking through any big problem or project. However, when it comes to the day-to-day work of a complex undertaking SMART doesn\u2019t have much to offer. This is a great system for anyone who is overwhelmed with the sheer size of their current project and needs a plan to move forward.\nIt\u2019s simple, it\u2019s easy to remember, and it doesn\u2019t require a lot of reading to get started.\nWant to learn more?\nUse S.M.A.R.T.",

A couple of things I've noticed about myself and the teams I've worked with:- We always find time to do things we love doing. So the trick is to simply fill your bucket with things you genuinely enjoy.- Always have a backlog. It might be a note or a sheet on Excel - but always have a list of things that need to get done. Keep adding the new stuff into this as they come, and spend a couple of hours once  a week running through this.- Get in the flow. Plan your backlog so you have a mix of high, medium and low complexity stuff on your plate.- Figure out your \\\"in-the-zone\\\" time. For me, I've noticed that I'm most charged up for creative work later in the evening. Make sure you don't have any meetings or distractions lined up during and at least an hour before your zone time.- Get your temple. Everybody needs a place where they can go, zone in and get work done.- Have a daily standup where you discuss what you planned to do yesterday, what you did, and what you plan to do today. Do this EVERY SINGLE DAY.I've noticed most organized/ disciplined folks just do this automatically.
