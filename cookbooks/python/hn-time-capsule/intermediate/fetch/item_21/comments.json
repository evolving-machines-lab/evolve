I didn't know the Eisenhower Matrix had a specific name.Not linked in the article (but worth a plug IMO) is the Mac app Vitamin-R [1].  I've started using it again lately and I'm finding it useful.  It combines several of the methodologies in the article: Pomodoro, Time Boxing and Biological Prime Time.  With the latter, after each pomodoro Vitamin-R asks whether you were in flow or felt distracted - over time it generates a graph of your peak productivity times & days of the week.[1] http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/",

        "text": "I've had to struggle with procrastination since highschool (now 10+ yrs in the workforce). A couple of things I've noticed about myself and the teams I've worked with:- We always find time to do things we love doing. So the trick is to simply fill your bucket with things you genuinely enjoy.- Always have a backlog. It might be a note or a sheet on Excel - but always have a list of things that need to get done. Keep adding the new stuff into this as they come, and spend a couple of hours once  a week running through this.- Get in the flow. Plan your backlog so you have a mix of high, medium and low complexity stuff on your plate.- Figure out your \"in-the-zone\" time. For me, I've noticed that I'm most charged up for creative work later in the evening. Make sure you don't have any meetings or distractions lined up during and at least an hour before your zone time.- Get your temple. Everybody needs a place where they can go, zone in and get work done.- Have a daily standup where you discuss what you planned to do yesterday, what you did, and what you plan to do today. Do this EVERY SINGLE DAY.I've noticed most organized/ disciplined folks just do this automatically. For us procrastinators, it's like starting a workout routine after your BMI has hit the ceiling - you need a system, and you need a system that you'd actually enjoy if you want to stick to it!",

Took a while to make it a habit, but now I can apply it to most meetings and emails -- I read, action then archive right there. So I hardly maintain a todo list of any sort. I make a list in the morning and finish/scratch off its items by the evening. Doing that daily, my mind is always refreshed about recurring or long term tasks. It seems to work for me.The other thing I found useful is that procrastination, or the getting-started-barrier is proportional to size/complexity of task. I keep breaking the task down to smaller units until I get to something that doesn't fill me with loathing when I think of it. And then I do it. That effectively starts the task.",

The value is in the reminder, because clearly we often don't take it to heart. It reminds me a bit of the late David Foster Wallace's increasing emphasis on the value of 'basic truths' even if they seem cliche. They're still true, and we suck at living by them. So why not remind ourselves often of their value?But perhaps your argument hinges on the assumption that 'hire a psychotherapist' is advice that diverts the attention from a more important issue.

I'm just trying to say that maybe it could be the nature of the work and how we see it.For example I am one of those who have really a lot of never-ending-awesome-side-projects. I'm fine with it.As soon as I realize that particular job is more fun 'not to be completed' but because it allows me to learn more, share with others, discover techniques and occasionally strange weird reasons (wage?)!\nThe completion is just a social reward (and yeah maybe I often fear the 'what to do next' desert).The path to completion is so much more valuable to me.We need more maxims to realize all the small ignored ends on the ongoing projects.\nSometimes an idea is cool because of one of those ends, which is already done, and it would be a shame (and a time loss) to force yourself to continue.P.S: I don't preach a do-never-finish lifestyle, it needs personal balance.",

No magic bullets, no special talent, no nothing. Just focus on being disciplined and have faith on us being creatures of habit (i.e. if you force yourself to do it, it will be easier in the future).  A special talent to get things done is cool, as well as being motivated, but - really - you can't rely on those to get things done. Talent comes and goes, much like motivation.

And I think there are tons of individual elements in GTD that are valuable even if the whole system is not applied. But for me it didn't work as a whole, and it's significantly less useful if not applied completely (but also significantly more powerful when it is).What seems to work best for me is a combination of two approaches:1. choosing up to three tasks to focus on per day, usually one major task, and two lesser tasks.\n2. using a simpler list of (usually) smaller or less important tasks for all the stuff that I can't dedicate a day or half-day to. I used Mark Forster's AutoFocus system for this for a while, and now I settled on the 'Final Version' that this evolved into: http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-...I think a crucial part for me is that I need a certain fluidity in my approach. The more complex, 'factory-checklist-like' the system is, the better.

Four requests for your list:- An App Setting to disable animation (it can be disorienting)- After navigating a cross-link, provide either a back button, or multiple breadcrumb trails in the navbar, when there are multiple \"parents\" or inbound paths.  On Android, NoteLynX Pro supports cross-references / multiple parents, http://astrodean.blogspot.com.  This is a valuable feature that few apps attempt, so thanks for including internal cross-ref links.  With the new \"Back to App\" feature in iOS9, cross-app hyperlink support would enable use of Mindscope as a contextual launcher.- Keyboard support, e.g. Delete to go back (cross-link) or up one level in the navigation hierarchy, hotkeys (e.g. Cmd-H for home, Cmd-W to \"close\" a sub-task and go up one level in the navigation hierarchy), Cmd-N to create a new entry centered in available whitespace. Mobile Safari supports similar key combos. Especially useful on iPad Pro.- For sync, please consider open-standard CalDav",

    "text": "My biggest problem with these list making solutions are what I call the collateral tasks. For example, my list says \"Buy a Christmas gift for Jen\".When I start shopping online, I realize that I don't know much about Jen, so I need to call a friend. Lots of discussion later, I finalize on something to buy then I need to think of a personal note to write.At the checkout, my banking application tells me that my internet password needs to be changed. The whole process gets aborted!Probably, I exaggerated a little but my point being that each task involves a million micro steps which may or may not be anticipated. No wonder there is a lot of procrastination!",

        "text": "Spot on.  We see this a lot in coding activities. Many tasks are usually more complicated than for example \"import this file into database, use the imported data to produce the histogram\" ... there's bound to be plenty of \"collateral\" shyte en route.  Non-programmers don't usually understand this.So how to overcome this?There's no other way than to cognitively \"bring to front\" the end goal every time you hit a task hurdle that threatens your concentration or that lets you succumb to distraction.  But it takes practice to learn that you are in the  process of beginning the \"shirk move\" ... watch out for this. Can you blame yourself when all you've done your whole life subconsciously toggle to other tasks when the going gets tough.  Blame evolution for this.So two things:1.  Know upfront the discrete sub-task/destination you are hoping to achieve for a given finite stretch of time, achieve it and call it the day; and2.  Kak on yourself solid! for being distracted during a tough spell ... speak it out to yourself by enunciating that you are being distracted, mofo.  If someone else is doing the disturbing, find a quiet place next time. (Working with kids in the house can be painful).That's why I am here!",

        "text": "It's really easy (and sometimes fun) to get mired in the \"planning\" phase of thing. You need to keep that drive when the things get more abstract and you'll eventually find the same drive again.For instance, choosing a method, that's easy. Doing a bunch of brainstorming and coming up with projects to apply that method too, that's easy (for me). It's that next step, where you're actually designing the infrastructure of the system that's difficult. Suddenly you're getting distracted by things like Operating Systems, web hosting, bandwidth requirements, APIs, etc. And it becomes this huge, abstract project.It's then that you need to stay focused. Even if you only commit to 20 minutes a day, you'll be surprised how far you get. I find that really it doesn't take that long for me to take an abstract problem and reduce it down to a component I can get up and running now. This reduces the amount of mental overhead I'm juggling drastically and allows me to continue.It's the same thing at work for me, have you ever had that experience where you finish a feature, and it's time to jump into the next one? And it's almost like you can't do it. You need to breathe, because you've just been so focused at such a low level on this one feature, and suddenly you have to open your brain up to imagine the entire f#$@ing system again! And you need to connect end points, think about data structures, algorithms, libraries.Another thing I recommend is trying to get some work done before you go to work. Your mind is pretty refreshed after a good nights rest and a decent breakfast, but much less so after two commutes and a good 8 hours in the office.Finally, in my area there are a ton of meetups. A lot of these are just hacker hours. You get a bit of social activity and they tend to keep my focused (since who's going to bust out Hulu and toss on Seinfeld at the monthly ViM meetup? There's someone talking about macros up there! MACROS!). I'd recommend finding some of those. The interchange of ideas, and being able to bounce ideas off other practiced programmers is another tangible benefit.And a free beer and slice of pizza (well never is definitely the wrong word here...) never hurt anyone.",
