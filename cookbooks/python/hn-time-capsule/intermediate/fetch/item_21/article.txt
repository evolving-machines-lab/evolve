The right productivity method can make a
huge
difference in your work. A friction-less workflow can take you from feeling overwhelmed, unfocused, and unproductive to feeling calm, in control, and prepared to take on even the biggest projects.
The good news is, there are new methods being developed, tweaked, and shared all the time. There’s bound to be a system out there that fits your unique personality and projects. But wading through the thousands of articles about different productivity systems can be a massive time commitment — time you could be using to actually get things done.
That’s why we decided to do the legwork for you. We’ve gathered the most powerful productivity methods and frameworks all in one convenient place. This post will give you a brief overview of the most popular and useful productivity methods, how each works, and what kind of person will find each useful. It’s designed to help you get set up with your ideal workflow as quickly as possible so you can start reaping the productivity benefits right away.
How to get the most out of this guide
First, we broke down the time commitment needed to get started with each method, rated with a simple
Low
,
Medium
, or
High
.
Eager to begin a huge project but feel completely lost whenever you try to start? Start with a method rated
Medium
or
High
.
Up against a hard deadline with a to-do list the length of California and a tendency to procrastinate under stress? Jump to the systems with a
Low
rating.
We’ve also indicated which methods are more
Visual
,
Tactile
, or
Abstract
— many are a combination. If you know which learning/work style you lean toward, you can skim through and jump to the methods that align best with your natural approach:
Visual
If you’re the kind of person who prefers maps over written or verbal directions, you’ll probably find the visual methods more satisfying.
Tactile
If you love the feeling of physically crossing items off a to-do list or you often find yourself strategizing by moving note cards around on the floor, you’ll probably feel most comfortable with tactile methods.
Abstract
If neither of those approaches sound like you — if you organize projects simply by writing it down or you strategize easily in your head with no physical or visual representation — you might find the abstract methods most useful. The upside of abstract methods is that they also tend to allow for more complexity in prioritizing and categorizing.
As you learn about the way that you work best, here are a few things to keep in mind:
The goal is to actually get stuff done.
While it’s common for new workflow to take extra time upfront, they should become increasingly effortless over time. If you find that sticking to a certain productivity method is taking up a significant amount of time, energy, and mental bandwidth, it’s probably not for you. That’s ok. There are plenty of other options out there.
You’re not married to one productivity method forever.
You may find that a given method is better suited to some of your projects, and not others. A method that used to work for you might become a burden to maintain later on, or you may need a more robust system to tackle a growing workload. Be flexible and don’t be afraid to make a change.
To borrow a phrase from Pirates of the Caribbean,
productivity methods are more what you’d call “guidelines” than actual rules.
The methods outlined below are great starting points, but they’re infinitely more powerful when you mold them to fit your specific work style. Experiment with different methods and mix and match to find your ideal workflow.

Time commitment to get started:
Low
Type:
Visual, Tactile
Perfect for people who:
Have a tendency to start a lot of projects but finish very few of them.
What it does:
Helps you visualize progress on all of your projects.
Personal Kanban is an incredibly simple system. And that can be a good thing. Sometimes all you need to make progress is a way to see the status of your projects laid out simply in front of you.
Here’s how Kanban works: Using whatever medium you prefer (sticky notes or a whiteboard work well), split your projects into three categories: To Do, Doing, and Done. That’s it.
But this simple system is more powerful than it seems.
By using a finite space for “To Do” and “Doing,” you’ll see how quickly those categories fill up. You get a constant, physical reminder when you need to concentrate on finishing your current projects before starting new ones. In addition, having all your work laid out in front of you helps you feel calm and in control of the big picture.

Eating Live Frogs: Do the Worst Thing First

hellostripes.blogspot.com
Time commitment to get started:
Low
Type:
Abstract
Perfect for people who:
Tend to put off important items, resulting in missed deadlines or rushed work.
What it does:
Helps to avoid procrastination while ensuring that you make progress on the
right
things.
A lot of productivity systems and tools are all about getting started. They assume that as long as you’re crossing
something
off your to-do list, you’re being productive. But in reality, it can make a big difference which task you pick first.
If you put off your most important tasks until the very last second, you’re not really improving your productivity on the things that matter. And, worse, you may find yourself missing deadlines or hurting your reputation by rushing through your most challenging work.
The term, “eating the frog first,” comes from that old well of ( delightfully snarky) wisdom, Mark Twain. He supposedly once said, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”
To get started, schedule your daily tasks from hardest to easiest. You’ll get your most important, intimidating, anxiety-inducing tasks(aka your frog) done while your energy is high and your day will get progressively better. You’re likely to find the overall quality of your work improves too.
A huge part of learning to be truly productive is accepting that the impulse to procrastinate is inevitable. Learning to work around your own self-destructive impulses is key. As Brian Tracy puts it in his book
Eat that Frog: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time
:
Everyone procrastinates. The difference between high performers and low performers is largely determined by what they choose to procrastinate on.

Must, Should, Want

Time commitment to get started:
Medium
Type:
Abstract, visual
Perfect for people who:
Need to prioritize tasks, but tend to go for lists over graphs.
What it does:
Prioritizes your tasks by urgency, ensures that you’re accomplishing the right things.
Must, Should, Want is all about figuring out what’s critical today and what can wait. Write down everything you have to do and then identify each as a Must, a Should, or a Want
.
Your Must tasks are non-negotiable.
“
Pay rent” — that’s a Must if it’s the first of the month.
A Should is something you need to do, but it’s not dire that it be done today. Answering certain emails may be a Should. It’s important, but delaying it a day or two may not be a big deal, especially if you have a list of Musts due tomorrow.
A Want is something you’d like to do, but might not be practical or necessary at the moment. It can be put off for the future, if need be. Learning a new language is a great goal, but if it’s a choice between getting eight hours of sleep every night and becoming conversational in Portuguese, you might not want to risk
the long-term effects of sleep deprivation
just to learn a new (albeit, beautiful) language.
A popular variation on this method, called MoSCoW, calls the “Want” category, “Could,” and adds another, “Won’t” for those pesky items that always seem to wind up on your to-do lists, but might not be worth your time and energy in the end.

The SMART Method

Time commitment to get started:
Medium
Type:
Abstract
Perfect for people who:
Are in the early phases of a big project and need to strategize before jumping in.
What it does:
Turns big, abstract ideas and goals into concrete, actionable plans.
There have been many adaptations and adjustments to the SMART productivity method since it was introduced three decades ago. At its core, SMART is a way to take a big, pie-in-the-sky idea and figure out how to make it work in the real world by asking yourself a series of questions. SMART is an acronym that stands for: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Timely.
Let’s break it down.
Specific:
Meaning the What — what is this project and what,
specifically,
do you want to accomplish?
Measurable:
These are the individual tasks and steps that add up to a complete project.
Assignable:
Who is going to do which step? Yes, this is another method that can work for teams, but don’t toss out this step if you’re working on a solo project. Chances are, if you’re using SMART you have a big project, and nothing that big can be accomplished 100% on your own.
If you have small children, you might use this step to think through childcare options. If you’re starting a business, you might reach out to a lawyer or financial planner. Every large undertaking requires some help along the way.
Clarifying how you’ll get that help will make it easier to get your project started.
Realistic:
This is the Debbie Downer of SMART. It encompasses all obstacles in your way, everything that could threaten your project. You can’t overcome a problem until you understand it completely. By carefully considering the challenges ahead, you can start mulling over solutions before they even get a chance to trip you up.
Timely:
Deadlines. Deadlines are an important part of nearly every successful productivity strategy, and with good reason. Time constraints force us to be efficient. Come up with reasonable deadlines for each measureable task — ideally giving you more time than you think you’ll need so you don’t fall victim to the
Planning Fallacy
.
Overall, SMART is perfectly suited for thinking through any big problem or project. However, when it comes to the day-to-day work of a complex undertaking SMART doesn’t have much to offer. This is a great system for anyone who is overwhelmed with the sheer size of their current project and needs a plan to move forward.
It’s simple, it’s easy to remember, and it doesn’t require a lot of reading to get started.
