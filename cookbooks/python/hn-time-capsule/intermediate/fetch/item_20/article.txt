WordPress.org The mysterious aging of astronauts When I took Physics courses in college, I learned about how astronauts should age a tiny bit slower than us. Of course, they would be exposed to a lot more radiation so they might develop more cancers. But all in all, I would have been excited about the prospect of living in space. Then the astronauts came back and we saw them being barely able to walk. Yet these were young men selected among thousands for their physical fitness. That was explained away by saying that the lack of gravity meant a lack of exercise. All these astronauts needed was a good workout. And future astronauts would have a “space gym” so it would all be alright. But then more results started coming back. Not only do astronauts come back with weak muscles and frail bones… But they also suffer from skin thinning, atherosclerosis (stiffer arteries), resistance to insulin and they suffer from loss of vision due to cataracts many years earlier than expected given their chronological age. These symptoms look a lot like skin aging, cardiovascular aging, age-related diabetes and so forth. In fact, it is pretty accurate to say that astronauts age at an accelerated rate. This is despite the fact that the current generation of astronauts follows a rigorous exercise program. They are also followed medically more closely than just about anyone on Earth: they don’t indulge in regular fast food. Trudel, one of the leading researchers on this front appears to think that lack of sufficiently strenuous exercise is the problem. He observed that resting greatly accelerates aging: “(…) after 60 days of bed rest, the marrow of the patients studied looked as if it had aged and grown by four years” (motherboard) When not attributed to a lack of sufficient exercise, many of these effects seem to be attributed to an increased exposure to radiation. Indeed, astronauts in the International Space Station are exposed to about ten times as much ambient radiation as the rest of us. However, there is only so much you can explain away with a slight increase in radiations. For example, people exposed to radiation grow cancers, they don’t develop diabetes. And even cancer is not a given: a small increase in radiation exposure can actually make you healthier through a process called hormesis. In fact, that’s precisely what exercise does: it is a stress on your body that makes you healthier. In any case, we do not know whether astronauts are more likely to die from cancer. Certainly, they don’t all fall dead at 40 from cancer… If there is an increased rate of cancer, it is fairly modest because, otherwise, we would not be worrying about how their skin is getting thinner. So it looks like despite short stays, and very attentive medical care, astronauts age at a drastically accelerated pace… not just in one or two ways but across a broad spectrum of symptoms. I looked as hard as I could and I could not find any trace of medical scientists worrying about such a phenomenon a priori. What is going on? Why does life in space accelerate aging so much? Gravity seems to play a key role: The more likely culprit is the relative lack of gravity in a microgravity environment, which scientists think has a negative influence on (…) metabolisms.

Reply Daniel Lemire says: December 1, 2015 at 7:15 pm We actually do expect astronauts to experience more cancers… Medical scientists have reported just about every bit of trouble that the astronauts experience… but nothing on an increase of cancer rates. We have no reason to believe that scientists would keep this information secret while divulging information about insulin resistance, say. So the most reasonable assumption is that if there is an increase in cancer rates, it is not huge. I personally think that there is an increase but if it might be no stronger than, say, taking up smoking. If so, you will have a hard time measuring the effect in a small population. This apparent lack of huge increase in cancer rates puts a dent in the theory that the accelerated aging is explained away entirely by increased exposure to radiation. If the radiations were so bad, you’d spot cancers well before you worry about diabetes or skin thinning. If you mean that astronauts are less likely to die of cancer because of early diagnostics… again, my argument would be the same: if astronauts commonly get diagnosed early for cancer… that would get reported. So “something” is going on and it is not Martians nor evil spirits, and it is probably not radiation alone. Reply J'raxis 270145 says: December 2, 2015 at 7:45 pm Just because there’s no increase in cancer, doesn’t mean that the radiation isn’t the cause of these other health problems. Radiation causes cancer by causing damage to DNA, but it’s not like radiation specifically targets the DNA; it damages any molecules that make up the human body that it strikes. The skin damage, the insulin resistance, the atherosclerosis, and so on, could all be caused by other parts of these respective cells and tissues being damaged. Outside of the astronaut population, I don’t think we’ve ever researched how elevated, ambient, full-body radiation over a period of weeks or months might affect the human body. All we’ve had to work with is sudden, massive exposures either body-wide (e.g., nuclear bombs, the “demon core” and similar incidents) or concentrated in a single area (e.g., medical X-rays, accidental ingestion/inhalation of radioactive material). Now perhaps we’re seeing how long-term, full-body exposure to radiation causes all sorts of permanent cellular or tissue damage beyond cancer. Reply Vettir says: December 3, 2015 at 6:21 pm Except we do have groups of people living in conditions with increased radiation their entire lives. Either due to increased height (Nepal, Andes) or due to higher levels of background radiation. I personally think the most likely cause is lack of gravity, since it really messes up a number of things we take for granted: fluids being pushed towards your feet, etc. There are certain chemical processes that are easier to do in zero g, might not there also be chemical processes that are harder to do? And either of those can cause premature aging. Reply Ryan says: December 5, 2015 at 2:41 am Exactly what I was thinking Vettir. The loss of tensile forces changing ECM or some other critical chemical component of these tissues. Alternatively, perhaps changes to protein expression due to biophysical changes in key receptor proteins within parenchymal or immune cells. Very interesting phenomenon. Reply Peter F. Foley says: December 5, 2015 at 8:08 pm Gravity is needed to create the stress fields that force movements of the various compounds of life inside and outside cellular walls. Some experiments comparing sea mammals to their on shore cousins could help isolate the areas of difference. Or studies of various amphibious reptiles and mammals that force individuals to stay in or out of the water for side effects. Reply Denver says: December 5, 2015 at 4:29 pm Early detection would increase the numbers of cancers counted. Reply Alvaro says: December 1, 2015 at 8:02 pm Stress? Stress is many times mentioned as the catalyst of several deseases.
