took Physics courses in college, I learned about how astronauts should age a tiny bit slower than us. Of course, they would be exposed to a lot more radiation so they might develop more cancers. But all in all, I would have been excited about the prospect of living in space. Then the astronauts came back and we saw them being barely able to walk. Yet these were young men selected among thousands for their physical fitness. That was explained away by saying that the lack of gravity meant a lack of exercise. All these astronauts needed was a good workout. And future astronauts would have a \u201cspace gym\u201d so it would all be alright. But then more results started coming back. Not only do astronauts come back with weak muscles and frail bones\u2026 But they also suffer from skin thinning, atherosclerosis (stiffer arteries), resistance to insulin and they suffer from loss of vision due to cataracts many years earlier than expected given their chronological age. These symptoms look a lot like skin aging, cardiovascular aging, age-related diabetes and so forth. In fact, it is pretty accurate to say that astronauts age at an accelerated rate. This is despite the fact that the current generation of astronauts follows a rigorous exercise program. They are also followed medically more closely than just about anyone on Earth: they don\u2019t indulge in regular fast food. Trudel, one of the leading researchers on this front appears to think that lack of sufficiently strenuous exercise is the problem. He observed that resting greatly accelerates aging: \u201c(\u2026) after 60 days of bed rest, the marrow of the patients studied looked as if it had aged and grown by four years\u201d (motherboard) When not attributed to a lack of sufficient exercise, many of these effects seem to be attributed to an increased exposure to radiation. Indeed, astronauts in the International Space Station are exposed to about ten times as much ambient radiation as the rest of us. However, there is only so much you can explain away with a slight increase in radiations. For example, people exposed to radiation grow cancers, they don\u2019t develop diabetes. And even cancer is not a given: a small increase in radiation exposure can actually make you healthier through a process called hormesis. In fact, that\u2019s precisely what exercise does: it is a stress on your body that makes you healthier. In any case, we do not know whether astronauts are more likely to die from cancer. Certainly, they don\u2019t all fall dead at 40 from cancer\u2026 If there is an increased rate of cancer, it is fairly modest because, otherwise, we would not be worrying about how their skin is getting thinner. So it looks like despite short stays, and very attentive medical care, astronauts age at a drastically accelerated pace\u2026 not just in one or two ways but across a broad spectrum of symptoms. I looked as hard as I could and I could not find any trace of medical scientists worrying about such a phenomenon a priori. What is going on? Why does life in space accelerate aging so much? Gravity seems to play a key role: The more likely culprit is the relative lack of gravity in a microgravity environment, which scientists think has a negative influence on (\u2026) metabolisms.

Reply Daniel Lemire says: December 1, 2015 at 7:15 pm We actually do expect astronauts to experience more cancers\u2026 Medical scientists have reported just about every bit of trouble that the astronauts experience\u2026 but nothing on an increase of cancer rates. We have no reason to believe that scientists would keep this information secret while divulging information about insulin resistance, say. So the most reasonable assumption is that if there is an increase in cancer rates, it is not huge. I personally think that there is an increase but if it might be no stronger than, say, taking up smoking. If so, you will have a hard time measuring the effect in a small population. This apparent lack of huge increase in cancer rates puts a dent in the theory that the accelerated aging is explained away entirely by increased exposure to radiation. If the radiations were so bad, you\u2019d spot cancers well before you worry about diabetes or skin thinning. If you mean that astronauts are less likely to die of cancer because of early diagnostics\u2026 again, my argument would be the same: if astronauts commonly get diagnosed early for cancer\u2026 that would get reported. So \u201csomething\u201d is going on and it is not Martians nor evil spirits, and it is probably not radiation alone. Reply J'raxis 270145 says: December 2, 2015 at 7:45 pm Just because there\u2019s no increase in cancer, doesn\u2019t mean that the radiation isn\u2019t the cause of these other health problems. Radiation causes cancer by causing damage to DNA, but it\u2019s not like radiation specifically targets the DNA; it damages any molecules that make up the human body that it strikes. The skin damage, the insulin resistance, the atherosclerosis, and so on, could all be caused by other parts of these respective cells and tissues being damaged. Outside of the astronaut population, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever researched how elevated, ambient, full-body radiation over a period of weeks or months might affect the human body. All we\u2019ve had to work with is sudden, massive exposures either body-wide (e.g., nuclear bombs, the \u201cdemon core\u201d and similar incidents) or concentrated in a single area (e.g., medical X-rays, accidental ingestion/inhalation of radioactive material). Now perhaps we\u2019re seeing how long-term, full-body exposure to radiation causes all sorts of permanent cellular or tissue damage beyond cancer. Reply Vettir says: December 3, 2015 at 6:21 pm Except we do have groups of people living in conditions with increased radiation their entire lives. Either due to increased height (Nepal, Andes) or due to higher levels of background radiation. I personally think the most likely cause is lack of gravity, since it really messes up a number of things we take for granted: fluids being pushed towards your feet, etc. There are certain chemical processes that are easier to do in zero g, might not there also be chemical processes that are harder to do? And either of those can cause premature aging. Reply Ryan says: December 5, 2015 at 2:41 am Exactly what I was thinking Vettir. The loss of tensile forces changing ECM or some other critical chemical component of these tissues. Alternatively, perhaps changes to protein expression due to biophysical changes in key receptor proteins within parenchymal or immune cells. Very interesting phenomenon. Reply Peter F. Foley says: December 5, 2015 at 8:08 pm Gravity is needed to create the stress fields that force movements of the various compounds of life inside and outside cellular walls. Some experiments comparing sea mammals to their on shore cousins could help isolate the areas of difference. Or studies of various amphibious reptiles and mammals that force individuals to stay in or out of the water for side effects. Reply Denver says: December 5, 2015 at 4:29 pm Early detection would increase the numbers of cancers counted. Reply Alvaro says: December 1, 2015 at 8:02 pm Stress? Stress is many times mentioned as the catalyst of several deseases. ",

I\\u2019m taking a course on it this semester (I\\u2019m a masters student in aerospace engineering)\\u2013let me summarize some of the problems that your body goes through during space travel.Humans spend about 70% of their time either standing or sitting. That means the human body is optimized for a hydrostatic pressure gradient like the one illustrated here (http://wiki.sdstate.edu/@api/deki/files/999/=1-BP_Change.png). Blood pressure is much higher at your feet than at your head. In space, however, there is no gravity to produce this gradient, so the cardiovascular system equalizes its pressure. That\\u2019s why astronauts suffer from \\u201cpuffy face\\u201d (higher-than-usual fluid pressures in head) and \\u201cchicken legs\\u201d (lower-than-usual fluid pressures in legs). In their first couple days in space, astronauts lose about 1L of leg volume from each leg.The CV system relies on internal pressure sensors to figure out how to operate, and the new pressure distribution confuses it. Astronauts lose a lot of blood plasma\\u2013it sort of ends up absorbed into the surrounding tissues. This increases the relative concentration of red blood cells, which triggers the body to slow down production of new ones. Also, the heart atrophies because it doesn\\u2019t need to pump as hard to move liquid around the body.When you come back from space, your body needs to rapidly readapt from microgravity to one gee. It is not very good at doing that. That\\u2019s why 63% of astronauts are unable to stand for ten minutes straight just after their return from short-duration space missions (see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPDST7EePXQ).There are other problems: the cells that are constantly building and destroying your bones fall out of alignment when you\\u2019re in microgravity, causing astronauts\\u2019 bones to change structure in a way that looks a lot like accelerated aging. Why? Not clear, but possibly related to the lack of repeated loading, as happens when you stand/walk in normal gravity. Astronauts end up with huge concentrations of calcium in their blood, which causes kidney stones. Astronauts in space average around 4 hours of sleep per night, and very few of them eat enough calories to maintain their body weight, so they lose muscle mass.Aerospace medicine is about half medical studies of astronauts and half studies of people on earth. It turns out that you can make most of these body changes happen by having people lie on their backs with the bed tilted down six degrees (head downward). Fascinating field. If you want to know more, I recommend the textbook \\u201cSpace Physiology\\u201d by Jay Buckey (amazon link here: http://smile.amazon.com/Space-Physiology-Jay-C-Buckey/dp/019...).\",\n    \"points\": null,\n    \"created_at\": \"2015-12-03T07:02:49.000Z\",\n    \"depth\": 0,\n    \"replies\": []\n  }\n]"
