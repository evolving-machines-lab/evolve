However that&#x27;s often times the case add yet most states don&#x27;t even site patients to choose between suffering and death. The patient suffered so much because the treatment worked, but not well enough to safe her. That however can happen with many well proven treatments as well. I have a relative who just got a port to feed her liquids, dive she cannot swallow anymore. That treatment will extend her life longer, but she well probably will just suffer longer and die soon anyways. This seems to be a constant trade off in health care these days and usually we decide blindly in favor of extending life regardless of the quality. How we judge experimental treatments seems completely different though.",

The risks of all these are going to be unknown in very novel approaches, and people with different values are going to vary in their preference.<p>Understanding those risks and developing guidelines on when to pay for what are one activity of the FDA and major payors like Medicare. A patient and family facing a decision about the value to them in a time of crisis is going to be a lot less informed than those agencies, and it will be a lot easier for a doctor to mislead them (intentionally or not, but doctors aren&#x27;t immune from over-optimism that their clever ideas might work).<p>At the same time, it does seem like there should be some protocol where a terminally-ill person can be considered sufficiently informed to take the risk. This is hard, because the risks accrue to individual parties (e.g. the university getting sued in this article) whereas the benefits are diffuse (medicine learns whether induced brain infections improve survival in glioblastoma patients). But without this protocol, we are always going to have stories of patients whose treatments and deaths could be teaching us life-saving lessons if only we could legally do what they want to do.",

My feeling is that without the option to have euthanasia (should things get worse) you are promising a tiny tiny chance of a possible cure but a large chance of increased suffering too.<p>The tiny chance of 40 more years of life <i>might</i> be worth it but its crazy to try experimental treatments as a first roll of the dice!",

We get to see Muizelaar&#x27;s perspective on why he (presumably) thought he was doing the right thing.<p>Part II: The Fall. Deaths, lawsuits, the expose, resignations.<p>Part III: Resolution. Maybe there is some value in an alternative approach that focuses on mechanism and iterates towards human trials via animal studies. But also, maybe there is something to be said about Muizelaar&#x27;s approach that our current medicolegal system isn&#x27;t equipped to handle.<p>To me, the structure of the article helped to underscore that Muizelaar might have been right, which is key for using this article as a way to learn about science and rationality as opposed to solely for its object-level information. Just listing the facts almost certainly would not have been as useful for getting that point across.",
