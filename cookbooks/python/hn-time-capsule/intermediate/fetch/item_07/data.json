The files don't exist on your normal filesystem - they exist on the server, perhaps in a container, or just some internal folder structure that the server controls..?

You can either have a localhost machine or a docker machine. Right now each workspace can only be bound to a single machine environment, but in a couple months we'll release multi machine bindings, so that you could launch a docker compose, for example, as a way to bind your workspace.The binding of your workspace happens behind the scenes. When you boot or shutdown the workspace, we take care of managing the machines. If you are using docker, then those machines are running out of process. If on linux we use docker natively. We use docker machine on mac or windows.Once the machines are booted, we bind all of your projects into the workspace, which are mounted into the machines. Inside of the workspace machine, we launch another version of che. Based upon the programming language you choose, we are running intellisense services inside of the machines. For java, we actually run the native JDT code.We then put RESTful wrappers around this, which enables the browser to have full intellisense capability. We have more work to do in integrating the JDT code with our restful wrappers and the UI, but it works well.We now support refactoring, a lot of content suggestions, find usages, and so forth.You can snapshot your workspace and use that image to load it again.Your files are dual mounted between Che the workspace manager and your workspace environment. If you edit files in one, they are updated in the other. so you can ssh into your workspace or not.

In a distributed cloud environment, it's developer bootstrapping, securing distributed workspaces, and moderning legacy build processes. These are capabilities that only exist when you have a shared distributed server system.We took the kernel and created a new IDE out of it to demonstrate a couple things:\\n1. Environment & workspace portability\\n2. RESTful services on top of language tools like JDT\\n3. Production / development container interoperability\\n4. Extension framework for a cloud IDEWe haven't launched Che yet becuase the legal & branding review process at Eclipse is extensive. We hope to finally be done within 3 more months.But we encourage everyone to check out 4.0 branch of git and then build that.It is doing a few things:\\n1. Worksapces are quietly powered by environments, backed by machines which are docker or localhost. This enables each workspace to be isolated with a stack apart from others.2. We will also demonstrate workspace portability. You can move an entire workspace and all of its tools from Che to Che, or from Che to cloud. And the environment will continue to run identically in each location.3. We are running the full JDT and other language services inside of the machine. We wrap these with RESTful wrapper. And then it allows the browser to gain capabilities for maven, refactoring, and a variety of powerful intellisence, and it's generally the same speed as localhost.4. You can then exec commands, debuggers, and ssh into the workspace machines.5. We have also done a project with Red Hat to enable your workspace environments to have the same docker container structure as production. We will shortly release a plug-in for OpenShift and Kubernetes that let's projects move back and forth with limited configuration. Becuase they are both running on a common container architecture.While we can solve workflow problems in our distributed system, such as a workflow we call continuous development, we wanted to have a fully fledged desktop IDE to demonstrate that this could have the performance and security of other types of tools. So we are working to have this installation be very fast and lightweight.You guys are seeing the intermediate builds so it's got a lot of rough edges.Note: Please if you are going to do some testing, try it on the 4.0 branch. The design is much better and the performance is very good. The 4.0 branch is when we started embedding the JDT services into the mini Che that runs inside of the workspace machines.\\ngit clone https://github.com/codenv/che\\ngit checkout 4.0\\ncd assembly-sdk\\nmvn clean install\",\n    \"points\": null,\n    \"created_at_i\": 1448976645\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 10656505,\n    \"author\": \"berns\",\n    \"text\": \"Can you comment on how this project differs from Orion?\",\n    \"points\": null,\n    \"created_at_i\": 1448986757\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 10657045,\n    \"author\": \"TylerJewell\",\n    \"text\": \"It's complementary.

Our goal was somewhat different. When I started Codenvy, it was after I had a pretty bad experience with developer tools. I had been offline from programming for 7+ years and lost most of my skills. When I tried to get current with maven, java, eclipse, tomcat, I was unable to get a simple program to compile.I had a simple thought - it should be possible to let anyone anywhere contribute to any project without first installing software. you should be able to click a link and then everything you need is generated for you - the workspace, the projects in that workspace, the environments that power those workspaces.Now, if you are on a desktop, you may want to wire in your existing IDE to integrate with that workspace. But if you are a product manager and just want to test some code, you don't want to install anything. So a browser experience is necessary then.Generally, we have never seen the browser experience as the replacement objective or substitute. But it is a necessary deliverable for those who do not wnat to bother with installing software first.Codenvy takes Che and is working to provide this sort of no-install workflow around a concept we call factories. You start in a private anonymous screen, click a link and everything you need to continue working is there. Really hard problem - that is what we focus on commercially.But at the core of it, we needed a portable workspace server that had a web IDE. We chose GWT for the development of the GUI because of the cross browser portability and performance optimization. It's a brutal technology but we get a lot of nice optimizations. We have started some explorations to support Vaadin for dynamic reloading of widgets and have some partners who may help us with a pure JavaScript client, too.We are embedding all of the language services within the machines that power the environments that the workspace is bound to. We use either localhost or docker depending upon your configuration. Since everything is within, the actual comms between browser and the workspace machine is limited. So you can get a pretty darn good expeirence. The file operations are localhost native, so we are able to process Java files with 50K lines at about the same speed that Eclipse or Netbeans does (minus the part of the file system being inside of the docker container).\",\n    \"points\": null,\n    \"created_at_i\": 1448978024\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 10655922,\n    \"author\": \"noxToken\",\n    \"text\": \"I've only used three different IDEs/editors with regularity: Eclipse, IntelliJ and Sublime Text.

We had to write that in JavaScript. I believe this is how C9 handles their support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.We had pretty decent support, but there were all sorts of issues: having to rewrite JDT services is nearly impossible and really the domain of language teams, the browser has limited context where many intellisense services need access to multiple directories and meta information, and there were some performance issues in certain edge cases that are hard to resolve without having certain I/O and cache mechanisms (which are readily available on file systems).So the VSCode model of reusing the language services and then layering on a stdin / stdout protocol is pretty smart. We are doing a similar approach with Che, but instead of stdin / stdout, we are packing a restful interface on top of the JDT & JavaScript services. We see some potential to consolidate vscode & other approaches into a multi-language intellisence server, powered by REST + stdin + stdout.
