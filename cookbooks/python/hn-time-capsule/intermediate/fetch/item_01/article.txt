doom-coding 
A DIY approach to coding on-the-go! 
As an aspiring builder, I sought out a way to keep coding while not at home. Thanks to some Claude-assisted research and troubleshooting, I can now code via the terminal on my phone anywhere at anytime via "Doom Coding" (think Doom Scrolling but more productive). 
After this 5-minute setup guide, you'll be able to "doom code" anywhere you have Internet connection. 
Code in the air! 
Code on a run! 
Even code at the club! 
I've been amazed by how much I can get done while being so far away from home. In Taiwan, I could access my computer in Philadelphia and coded a prototype in my downtime. 
Shameless plug: check out www.friendlyr.ai to help shape the future of connection! 
Make sure to "Watch" this repo for future updates to this doom coding guide. As I tryout the latest mobile coding tools (e.g. Claude Code on the Web), I'll update this repository with comparisons. 
Happy doom coding my friends! 
What You'll Need 
A Computer running 24/7 with Internet Connection A Smartphone A Claude Pro subscription Overview 
Use Tailscale, Termius, Claude Code, and a computer running 24/7 to continue building anywhere you have Internet connection. 
Getting Started 
1. Set Up Your Computer 
Disable sleep in power settings Enable SSH/Remote Login Install Tailscale and sign in https://tailscale.com/download Install Claude Code on your computer https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview 2. Set Up Your Phone 
Install Tailscale → Sign in with the same account https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037 
Install Termius (A Mobile Terminal Tool) https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-modern-ssh-client/id549039908 
Note the MagicDNS address of your computer (e.g. my-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net) 
Create a new host in Termius: 
Label: What you want your connection to be called Hostname: The MagicDNS address (my-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net) Port: 22 Username/Password: Your login for your computer 3. Connect and Code 
Turn on Tailscale VPN on your phone Select your host in Termius Run claude and start coding! Troubleshooting 
If you're not able to establish a connection from your phone via Termius to your computer: 1. Reset your Tailscale VPN 
Check your phone settings to make sure you are connected to the Tailscale VPN. Check the Tailscale app to make sure the Tailscale VPN is on. If your phone and doom coding computer do not have a green circle next to their labels, there is an issue with your Tailscale/Internet connection. 2. Make sure your computer is ON and UNLOCKED 
When disconnecting/reconnecting power, make sure you unlock the computer. I've ran into this issue one too many times. 
Best Practices 
Track your progress: 
End sessions by asking Claude to update CLAUDE.md with where you left off. 
Preview websites: 
Go to your desired directory and start an HTTP server python -m http.server 3005 then visit http://your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net:3005/your-html-file.html in a browser on your phone. 
Wherever you would use localhost:PORT to view an app on your computer, replace localhost with the computer's MagicDNS from the Tailscale app (e.g. your-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net) 
View databases: 
Use the PostgreSQL app to view databases for your projects https://apps.apple.com/us/app/postgresql-client/id1233662353 
Bookmark useful sites: 
On your computer, bookmark the sites you refer to during development (e.g. Google OAuth, GitHub) to make it easier to reference from your phone. I use the Chrome app to seamlessly access the sites I need. 
Happy Doom Coding! 
Please contibute your best practices! I am looking forward to seeing all the places you will code!
