Thanks to some Claude-assisted research and troubleshooting, I can now code via the terminal on my phone anywhere at anytime via \"Doom Coding\" (think Doom Scrolling but more productive). \nAfter this 5-minute setup guide, you'll be able to \"doom code\" anywhere you have Internet connection. \nCode in the air! \nCode on a run! \nEven code at the club! \nI've been amazed by how much I can get done while being so far away from home. In Taiwan, I could access my computer in Philadelphia and coded a prototype in my downtime. \nShameless plug: check out www.friendlyr.ai to help shape the future of connection! \nMake sure to \"Watch\" this repo for future updates to this doom coding guide. As I tryout the latest mobile coding tools (e.g. Claude Code on the Web), I'll update this repository with comparisons. \nHappy doom coding my friends! \nWhat You'll Need \nA Computer running 24/7 with Internet Connection A Smartphone A Claude Pro subscription Overview \nUse Tailscale, Termius, Claude Code, and a computer running 24/7 to continue building anywhere you have Internet connection. \nGetting Started \n1. Set Up Your Computer \nDisable sleep in power settings Enable SSH/Remote Login Install Tailscale and sign in https://tailscale.com/download Install Claude Code on your computer https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview 2. Set Up Your Phone \nInstall Tailscale \u2192 Sign in with the same account https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037 \nInstall Termius (A Mobile Terminal Tool) https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-modern-ssh-client/id549039908 \nNote the MagicDNS address of your computer (e.g. my-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net) \nCreate a new host in Termius: \nLabel: What you want your connection to be called Hostname: The MagicDNS address (my-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net) Port: 22 Username/Password: Your login for your computer 3. Connect and Code \nTurn on Tailscale VPN on your phone Select your host in Termius Run claude and start coding! Troubleshooting \nIf you're not able to establish a connection from your phone via Termius to your computer: 1. Reset your Tailscale VPN \nCheck your phone settings to make sure you are connected to the Tailscale VPN. Check the Tailscale app to make sure the Tailscale VPN is on. If your phone and doom coding computer do not have a green circle next to their labels, there is an issue with your Tailscale/Internet connection. 2. Make sure your computer is ON and UNLOCKED \nWhen disconnecting/reconnecting power, make sure you unlock the computer. I've ran into this issue one too many times. \nBest Practices \nTrack your progress: \nEnd sessions by asking Claude to update CLAUDE.md with where you left off. \nPreview websites: \nGo to your desired directory and start an HTTP server python -m http.server 3005 then visit http://your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net:3005/your-html-file.html in a browser on your phone. \nWherever you would use localhost:PORT to view an app on your computer, replace localhost with the computer's MagicDNS from the Tailscale app (e.g. your-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net) \nView databases: \nUse the PostgreSQL app to view databases for your projects https://apps.apple.com/us/app/postgresql-client/id1233662353 \nBookmark useful sites: \nOn your computer, bookmark the sites you refer to during development (e.g. Google OAuth, GitHub) to make it easier to reference from your phone. I use the Chrome app to seamlessly access the sites I need. \nHappy Doom Coding! \nPlease contibute your best practices! I am looking forward to seeing all the places you will code! \nAbout A guide for how to use your smartphone to code anywhere at anytime. \nResources Readme \nUh oh! There was an error while loading.

It&#x27;s purpose is for: internet, using Microsoft products when I&#x27;m forced to, Zoom&#x2F;meetings, and SSH (or Mosh).<p>Most of my work is <i>not</i> done on this Macbook, instead I use it mostly as a terminal. I have a desktop that&#x27;s sitting behind my TV so that it can <i>be</i> my TV and gaming system (yeah I know Monitor &gt; TV. I&#x27;m a filthy casual and I don&#x27;t care). I have a mouse connected to that computer and instead of using a keyboard I use ydotool (Wayland xdotool) with a shortcut on my iPhone or a script on my android phone or from my Macbook. I don&#x27;t have to get up from the couch and I don&#x27;t need a clunky wireless keyboard to clutter my livingroom.<p>Additionally I have a few pis and an old android phone with Tailscale installed on them. That&#x27;s come in handy before as a machine&#x27;s been disconnected and so I couldn&#x27;t ssh from outside. Also makes it really easy to do a jump if you want to keep a machine off Tailscale or you don&#x27;t have full control (like my 3D printer).<p>This setup is very natural feeling if you live in the terminal. I actually started doing this when I started doing HPC work. In a setting like that you&#x27;re never sitting in front of the computer you&#x27;re doing most of your work on so it kinda clicked &quot;why was I restricting myself outside work?&quot; Plus there&#x27;s the side benefits of I always have access to my media, tools, and other stuff. You can do exactly the same thing with a phone but I like having a keyboard and the air is very lightweight and has a long battery life. Any netbook would have done the job tbh.<p>[0] There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re called &quot;terminal <i>emulator</i>s&quot; rather than just &quot;terminals&quot;.\",\n            \"points\": 0,\n            \"created_at\": 1767736397,\n            \"children\": [\n              {\n                \"id\": 46520451,\n                \"author\": \"mkoubaa\",\n                \"text\": \"Things are trending this way.
