It&#x27;s purpose is for: internet, using Microsoft products when I&#x27;m forced to, Zoom&#x2F;meetings, and SSH (or Mosh).<p>Most of my work is <i>not</i> done on this Macbook, instead I use it mostly as a terminal. I have a desktop that&#x27;s sitting behind my TV so that it can <i>be</i> my TV and gaming system (yeah I know Monitor &gt; TV. I&#x27;m a filthy casual and I don&#x27;t care). I have a mouse connected to that computer and instead of using a keyboard I use ydotool (Wayland xdotool) with a shortcut on my iPhone or a script on my android phone or from my Macbook. I don&#x27;t have to get up from the couch and I don&#x27;t need a clunky wireless keyboard to clutter my livingroom.<p>Additionally I have a few pis and an old android phone with Tailscale installed on them. That&#x27;s come in handy before as a machine&#x27;s been disconnected and so I couldn&#x27;t ssh from outside. Also makes it really easy to do a jump if you want to keep a machine off Tailscale or you don&#x27;t have full control (like my 3D printer).<p>This setup is very natural feeling if you live in the terminal. I actually started doing this when I started doing HPC work. In a setting like that you&#x27;re never sitting in front of the computer you&#x27;re doing most of your work on so it kinda clicked &quot;why was I restricting myself outside work?&quot; Plus there&#x27;s the side benefits of I always have access to my media, tools, and other stuff. You can do exactly the same thing with a phone but I like having a keyboard and the air is very lightweight and has a long battery life. Any netbook would have done the job tbh.<p>[0] There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re called &quot;terminal <i>emulator</i>s&quot; rather than just &quot;terminals&quot;.",

The understanding I gained secondary to generative act. I now understand the button on a Hue bridge literally just tells the device to issue a new API key at the next request.

You get a normal Claude Code experience, but multiplexed. The switcher&#x2F;UI shows you the status of Claude and the PR (pushed, merge conflicts, CI status, review status, etc.)<p>- Manage sessions via a web UI. Connect to Claude Code directly via your browser. You have access to the usual Claude Code terminal or a native chat view.<p>- Manage sessions via an app. You have access to a native chat view.<p>It achieves isolation via Git worktrees + a proxy so that containers have access to zero credentials (there aren&#x27;t even any Claude code creds in the container), which allows you to more safely use bypass all permissions mode.<p>This works better for me that Claude Code on Web because I have control over the environment Claude is running in. I can give it any Docker image I want, I can have it connect to my local network, etc.<p>It&#x27;s still a WIP (the core bits are there, but it&#x27;s not polished yet), but I&#x27;m hoping it provides a friendlier UX with a similar goal for what the OP has in mind.",

We got it done, but it was torture, tapping out messages with the Palm&#x27;s stylus.",
