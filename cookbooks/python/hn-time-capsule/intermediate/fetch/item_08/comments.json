So when they flew too high and fast to be intercepted, they were basically useless when it came to doing damage.2) This was already in the Kamikaze era of the war, and many B-29s were lost to that.Anyway, I&#x27;m not going to rewatch the whole 45-minute long episode again. I found some stats that listed a total of 74 lost from fighters, but I&#x27;m hesitant to post because I can&#x27;t dig up the original source (it 404s now). Will if you so desire. The number lost due to weather, mechanical failure, etc., dwarf the number lost to fighters by a huge factor but it does make the original quote here sound like some amount of propaganda bullshit.",

There are also instances of B29s downing MiGs over Korea.The late model B17s were pretty effective too. An old Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine quoted stats for two different air forces (recall it was the &quot;US Army Air Corps&quot; and &quot;Air Forces&quot; were simply an organizational unit) operating out of Britain over a two year period in WWII, one was bombers and the other fighters. Both shot down roughtly the same number of planes -- but the bombers used 100x as much ammunition. (Sorry, this is a 1970s print publication, no link, just my memory.)Also recall that the Japanese lost almost all their trained pilots early in the war, so the B29 was using a far superior weapon system against very inexperienced pilots.",

Not many pilots are willing to sit directly in the path of machine gun fire, even if it is not very accurate. German anti-aircraft figured this out as well. They switched to shooting mostly tracer rounds. You aren&#x27;t going to hit anything in the first place, so you might as well just scare the crap out of them.There were some WWII &#x27;gunship&#x27; style modifications of planes, but that was not that common.For a more modern comparison, consider that the Bradley fighting vehicle carries anti tank missiles. Sending a group of Bradleys directly against tanks would be suicidal. The Bradley has aluminum for armor. A well trained set of tank crews operating even WWII vintage vehicles would decimate them. Instead, the misiles are there to deter tanks from engaging them. It also provides the crew with an enormous psychological benefit. That benefit is they at least have the benefit of being able to respond to an enemy tank with a potentially lethal weapons system. Ironically of course the TOW missiles on the Bradley destroyed more Iraqi tanks the M1 tank ever did in the Gulf war. But that is because Iraqi tank crews either had no experience or had armored vehicles in horrible condition.",

If not, well, another B17 down.If that didn&#x27;t work for the 109s, they&#x27;d do a head on attack. A head on attack made it very hard for the B17s to hit them, and the closing speed was so fast it would carry the 109s out of range quickly after the attack.My father said that unlike the buffoonish German pilots portrayed in WW2 movies, the real ones were careful, professional, and deadly.

See the bomber guns had an effective range of 1000 yards or whatever so if you stood off 1200 yards in your ME-109 and launched rockets that blew up in 1200 yards that worked pretty well.I&#x27;ve read a couple memoirs of WWII pilots, interesting stuff.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re all dead now, whats documented out there is all we&#x27;ll ever have.As for effectiveness, well, bomber aircraft losses were tremendous until the end of the war, yet they lost the war anyway.  So its hard to say.  If you can down 10% of the B-17 per bombing run against ball bearing factories, but still lose the war, was it effective or not?  Or looking at the staggering economic and logistics costs of the air war, skipping the air war and focusing on shipping over tanks that don&#x27;t suck might have ended the war in &#x27;44 or earlier, so maybe it was ineffective.  Imagine if the winter battle of the bulge never happened because the war was already over by winter rather than lasting till spring.  Or maybe no bombing would have meant more hardware would have meant the D-day invasion getting pushed back into the sea Dunkirk II style.  Its an evenly balanced enough argument that academics will never lack for discussion topics.",

I&#x27;m not sure that better tanks would have made as much difference; and, furthermore, I suspect that the US was able to absorb the costs of the air war without much difficulty, so it wasn&#x27;t really siphoning resources away from things like tanks.I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the Sherman tank. On the one hand, it was famously under-armored and under-gunned; on the other hand, it was fast, maneuverable, reliable, fuel efficient, cheap to produce, and perhaps easier to ship across the ocean than heavier German-style tanks would have been. So, in the final accounting, I&#x27;m not sure if it was really a bad tank or if its shortcomings were justified in the big picture.I&#x27;m not any kind of WWII expert, so please fill me in on what I don&#x27;t know.",

        "text": "I used to be a gunner on an M1A1, and although we had laser range finders, we also practiced with the old style optical sights that were installed alongside the main gun.  How range finding works with optical sites is you usually have a series of marks in the viewfinder that you use to physically measure what you&#x27;re aiming at, so if the tank&#x2F;plane&#x2F;whatever is between particular two pips (or whatever; edit iirc the M1 had two curved lines you would placer over the target) you know that it&#x27;s about x meters away. The pips are calculated knowing the average length of the object, so this is, in practice, close enough.The procedure is; measure the target, then use cross marks on the cross hairs to raise the gun tube to the appropriate level, manually guess lead and defilade, fire, on the way. It obviously takes practice to get good at.  I found it curious that the US Army continued to teach&#x2F;train&#x2F;use this method, as well as land navigation with compass&#x2F;mapp instead of gps. The idea is to not rely on technology entirely.Edit: turns out I am describing stadiametric rangefinding:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stadiametric_rangefinding",

            "text": "Regarding teaching land navigation by compass:I teach light infantry tactics to new lieutenants for the US Army.  There&#x27;s a couple reasons to use old-school methods over relying on your GPS:* Using a compass and a map gives you a much better feel for terrain.  One of the common problems with lieutenants is a disregard for advantages and disadvantages of specific terrain.  I feel that this is by far the most important point.  Understanding and visualizing terrain from a map is a hugely valuable skill that impacts most points of an operation, specifically route planning, where to place your machine guns, and where to attack the objective from.* GPS can be jammed.  This point was driven home hard by the novel Ghost Fleet.  Ghost Fleet is a white paper turned into a novel (because no one would read a whitepaper) on what a future war with China would look like.  I&#x27;m pretty sure Ghost Fleet is also the impetus for the Naval Academy re-adding celestial navigation to their classwork.* GPS doesn&#x27;t always work, or takes a while to get enough satellites to get a fix.  You know what really sucks: taking fire and not knowing where you are.* Batteries are heavy.  Yes, tech is improving and you typically only need AA batteries.  But soldier weight for light infantry is and continues to be a challenge.",

        "text": "I don&#x27;t know about the B-29 system in particular, but gyroscopic gunsights used on most WW2 fighters were fairly straightforward.  First, you set a selector on the sight to the wingspan of your target (usually there would be presets for common enemy aircraft).  Then you twist a knob (typically on the throttle) that adjusts a ring in the sight until it matches the size of the target - this establishes the range.  Finally a gyroscope provides input on how your aircraft is moving, and since you&#x27;re typically maneuvering to follow your target this is an approximation of the target&#x27;s movement.There&#x27;s a lot of approximation involved, but generally it&#x27;s good enough to hit an airplane sized target, especially on US fighters where you typically have 4-8 machine guns spitting out 50+ bullets per second in a shotgun like pattern.Some relevant links:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i651.photobucket.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;uu236&#x2F;ken1926&#x2F;P-51DK_03.j...http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lonesentry.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;ta...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;d&#x2F;d7&#x2F;P-47_gun...",
