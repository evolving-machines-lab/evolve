Or maybe that female brains are better at multitasking. But there is no such thing as a female or male brain, according to the first search for sex differences across the entire human brain. It reveals that most people have a mix of male and female brain features. And it also supports the idea that gender is non-binary, and that gender classifications in many situations are meaningless. \u201cThis evidence that human brains cannot be categorised into two distinct classes is new, convincing, and somehow radical,\u201d says Anelis Kaiser at the University of Bern, Switzerland. The idea that people have either a \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale\u201d brain is an old one, says Daphna Joel at Tel Aviv University in Israel. \u201cThe theory goes that once a fetus develops testicles, they secrete testosterone which masculinises the brain,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that were true, there would be two types of brain.\u201dAdvertisement To test the theory, Joel and her colleagues looked for differences in brain scans taken from 1400 people aged between 13 and 85. The team looked for variations in the size of brain regions as well as the connections between them. In total, the group identified 29 brain regions that generally seem to be different sizes in self-identified males and females. These include the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, and the inferior frontal gyrus, which is thought to play a role in risk aversion. \u201cThere are not two types of brain\u201d When the group looked at each individual brain scan, however, they found that very few people had all of the brain features they might be expected to have, based on their sex. Across the sample, between 0 and 8 per cent of people had \u201call-male\u201d or \u201call-female\u201d brains, depending on the definition. \u201cMost people are in the middle,\u201d says Joel. This means that, averaged across many people, sex differences in brain structure do exist, but an individual brain is likely to be just that: individual, with a mix of features. \u201cThere are not two types of brain,\u201d says Joel. Spatial awareness Although the team only looked at brain structure, and not function, their findings suggest that we all lie along a continuum of what are traditionally viewed as male and female characteristics. \u201cThe study is very helpful in providing biological support for something that we\u2019ve known for some time \u2013 that gender isn\u2019t binary,\u201d says Meg John Barker, a psychologist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. The findings will still come as a surprise to many, including scientists, says Bruce McEwen at the Rockefeller University in New York. \u201cWe are beginning to realise the complexity of what we have traditionally understood to be \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019, and this study is the first step in that direction,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it will change peoples\u2019 minds.\u201d Markus Hausmann at Durham University, UK, isn\u2019t surprised by the findings, however. He has been studying sex differences in cognition, such as whether men, as commonly believed, really do have better spatial awareness than women. \u201cAcross all kinds of spatial skills, we find very, very few that are sensitive to sex,\u201d says Hausmann. \u201cWe have also identified spatial problems where women outperform men \u2013 the black-and-white idea of a male or female brain is clearly too simple.\u201d Cultural expectations Despite persisting stereotypes, girls are no worse than boys at science and maths subjects, either. \u201cPeople get wedded to the idea that being male or female is highly predictive of having different aptitudes or career choices,\u201d says Margaret McCarthy, who studies brain sex differences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. \u201cThis study fights against the idea that these outcomes are based on biological differences, as opposed to cultural expectations.\u201d Other body systems are also often wrongly considered to be either male or female, says Joel. Alexandra Kautzky-Willer, head of the Gender Medicine Unit at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, agrees that things aren\u2019t so simple. \u201cThere are differences between men and women when you look in large groups, and these are important for diagnosis and treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are always more differences within genders. We always need to look at culture, environment, education and a person\u2019s role in society,\u201d she says. If a neuroscientist was given someone\u2019s brain without their body or any additional information, they would still probably be able to guess if it had belonged to a man or a woman. Men\u2019s brains are larger, for example, and are likely to have a larger number of \u201cmale\u201d features overall. But the new findings suggest that it is impossible to predict what mix of brain features a person is likely to have based on their sex alone. Genderless future Joel envisions a future in which individuals are not so routinely classified based on gender alone. \u201cWe separate girls and boys, men and women all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, not just politically, but scientifically \u2013 everyone is different.\u201d But other scientists contacted by New Scientist don\u2019t think that will ever be possible \u2013 as a sexually reproductive species, identifying a person\u2019s biological sex will always be of paramount importance to us, they say. Even so, Joel\u2019s findings can be used to help many people understand the non-binary nature of gender, says Barker. After all, some people don\u2019t identify as either male or female, and others feel their gender identity shift over time. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that people\u2019s experience alone isn\u2019t enough for us to recognise as a society that non-binary gender is legitimate.\u201d \u201cWe need to start thinking a lot more carefully about how much weight we give to gender as a defining feature of human beings, and stop asking for it in situations where it simply isn\u2019t relevant,\u201d says Barker.
