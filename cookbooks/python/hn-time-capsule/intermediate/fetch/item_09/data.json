Signal Desktop brings the trusted private messaging experience of Signal to the desktop, with a simplicity that allows you to seamlessly continue conversations back and forth between your mobile device and your desktop computer. Private messaging, now with all ten fingers As always, everything is end-to-end encrypted and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication safe \u2013 allowing you to send high-quality private group, text, picture, and video messages for free. Multiple devices, single identifier Signal Desktop is a Chrome app which links with your phone, so all incoming and outgoing messages are displayed consistently on all your devices. Your contacts don\u2019t have to guess where to message you, and when you switch devices the conversation you started will already be there. Android devices only, for now Update : Signal Desktop for iOS is here! Read more . For the initial Signal desktop beta, only linking to Android devices is supported. Follow us on Twitter for updates on when the iOS app supports Signal Desktop. View source All of our code is free, open source, and available on GitHub . This allows experts to verify our protocols and our implementations. Like everything we do at Open Whisper Systems, dedicated development is supported by community donations and grants.

Without some of these affordances, a chat app has simply has no chance of gaining widespread adoption in such a competitive landscape. This is why it is very difficult to justify pouring any significant resources into building a decentralized chat app, because too few people will ever end up using it to justify the investment.

For example, paraphrasing quite a lot - uniqueness of names requires ordering; ordering probably requires consensus; consensus has a Sybil problem for which some kind of countermeasure is needed.  So a namespacing problem that seems simple, and is simple in a centralised/trusted context, may only be practical to solve with a blockchain-like structure with a computationally-heavy proof-of-work in a distributed trust architecture.  Even that may still be vulnerable to attacks from someone who can outcompute the rest of the network: and a Nation State Adversary (as a friend snarkily puts it) may actually have enough budget to try that.  There may be another way, but maybe not another way that satisfies all the security requirements or that would survive an attack.  And there are still other niches you need to worry about, like homoglyph attacks. That's a long way to go just to make sure that there aren't two ~bobs!  So you end up thinking, maybe it's better to find another way that ~alice knows she's talking to the right ~bob?  Then you have rephrased your security problem as more of a UX problem: how do I try to avoid impersonation? - which is perhaps more practical to solve another way. [Edit: Also, now your users won't have to fight over who gets to take ~bob first. This may or may not be an advantage, depending on how you feel about username exclusivity.] It's going to require a lot of hard work to solve this type of problem comprehensively; in the meantime, Signal does more or less the best we can do practically right now, and there's a lot of value in a practical solution that's best-in-class, works and millions of people can just pick up and use now.\",\n    \"points\": null,\n    \"created_at\": \"2015-12-02T20:56:51.000Z\",\n    \"depth\": 3\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 10665465,\n    \"author\": \"tptacek\",\n    \"text\": \"Because that's still an unsolved research problem.
