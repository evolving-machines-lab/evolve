  "article.txt": "Clojure wins on readability as well as writability. The easiest way it does that is by drastically reducing the amount of code youhave towrite for whatever random thing you'd otherwise do in Java. It opens the door even further for additional savings compared to other languages in a similar place like Python or Ruby by providing macros.Freedom from the Kingdom of Nouns alone gives you a big win in readability. Naming things is hard, and when the thing you care about isn't the Class but the Method then bothering to name a wrapper Class is additional overhead, an extra \"what is this in my code?\" that you need to make room for in your brain -- additionally it's common practice in Java world to put that Class in its own file all by itself, often in a totally different namespace, and often physically far away from where it's actually used when looking at the files on the filesystem, which further increases the cognitive load of knowing where your code lives. IDEs in the land of Java are helpful only because they are necessary because without them the cognitive load is just too much for any reasonably complicated project.Freedom from mandatory static typing of the sort Java has saves you from pointless class wrappers, pointless POJOs that must have names and live in their own files and namespaces, you are free to just use maps of keywords to values. Free to work with the data directly rather than an ad-hoc aliasing scheme that might decide to hide things you need or surprise you with nulls. When you want protocol or interface adherence, it is there for you, but it is not mandatory for everything.Maintaining Clojure is easier because there's less of it. A new hire can be pointed to your code of n files and told to spend a week reading and playing in the REPL, versus pointed to n2 files and told to spend a month reading and inserting breakpoints here and there to understand all the chaotic flows across what and where. You have a legitimate shot at picking 10 random Clojure files out of the project and understanding a bit about the data flows in them in relationship to the project as a whole, but in Java you're going to need a lot more context, especially if you get unlucky and pick out 10 MyCustomException classes. What is there in Clojure can be very dense, but it can be apparent in code review when you went too far, and then it's easy to refactor and you don't need any auto-refactor tools. You just substitute expressions, add comments, and name only what needs to be named, you can do it all without constantly needing to restart your program because (unless you're using JRebel) you added a function here or changed a parameter there.Java is good for risk-averse corporations -- a single average Dev on an average size team can't do very much, many corporate programmers average around 1000-2000 lines of codeper year* even with their IDEs helping them, and because of that they can cheaply be replaced or moved to another part of the project.",

I found going from the batteries-included Python to the very limited strict C89 ansi-pedantic-standard rather annoying, but at the same time I got a lot of pleasure building a game from scratch in SDL instead of using a full-fledged engine that would have replaced a lot of my code with one-liners or even automagically managed bits in the background. I think a more overkill approach is better economically than being conservative, and in Lisp especially including a ton of common macros like 'or out of the box saves every other programmer from writing their own. I could go the rest of my life without seeing yet another custom <insert data structure here> in C or C++ which has a good implementation natively in almost every other language. I wish JavaScript had more builtin as I'm often in the position that things I take for granted as being there in Python, Java, or Clojure require me to roll my own in JS and that can easily take hundreds of lines of my own code or dependencies depending on what it is. (e.g. anything involving large integers.) I'm greatly thankful for regex support in my daily languages. I remember in a high school programming contest, one guy didn't know Java had regexes (or even what regexes were) while I knew them from using them in PHP to validate form inputs... Needless to say, he never got a fully working parser in the time he had for the problem.You may find https://github.com/jonase/kibit helpful for some things. Otherwise I'd recommend just dedicating time to exploring the builtins so that you can resist the urge to wander while you should be programming -- there was a very interesting series a few years back some blogger made that covered all of Python's builtin modules, doing it yourself (or maybe there's one now for Clojure) is worthwhile.

With GC the runtime does this for you, and you can focus on other things.Same thing applies with mutable and immutable data. With mutable data structures all the changes are done in place, and you have to keep track of everywhere it's used to update it predictably. With immutable data structures you're \\\"copying\\\" the data any time you make a change, and the runtime keeps track of the references for you.\",\n                          \"title\": null,\n                          \"type\": \"comment\",\n                          \"url\": null\n                        },\n                        {\n                          \"author\": \"NhanH\",\n                          \"children\": [],\n                          \"created_at\": \"2015-12-02T22:53:12.000Z\",\n                          \"created_at_i\": 1449096792,\n                          \"id\": 10666496,\n                          \"options\": [],\n                          \"parent_id\": 10666428,\n                          \"points\": null,\n                          \"story_id\": 10657435,\n                          \"text\": \"Arguably, first class higher order function (and immutability) is defining characteristics of functional programming.Although, I don't think the functional/ imperative is necessary a good axis for categorizing languages.

However, if you insists on arguing from history, let's look at the long term trend. Would you agree that the trend of programming language is progressing to higher and higher level of abstraction and further and further away from the machine details? From machine code, to assembly language, to C, to Java, and now FP languages, this trend of mainstream programming language evolution is very clear. In this sense, if you take Lisp as a pioneer of function programming, it was simply ahead of its time.If you are implying that Lisp syntax is somehow an impediment to its popularity. That may well be. It's a personal preference issue. Some people like more syntax in their language, some people like less. If you are in the later camp, Lisp is surely very attractive. For example, in your kotlin one-liner, there are just too much syntax to understand \\\"()\\\", \\\"..\\\", \\\".\\\", \\\"{}\\\", etc. Life is too short, I just don't want to learn all these idiosyncrasy invented by someone just for the sake of being different.

The easiest way it does that is by drastically reducing the amount of code you have to write for whatever random thing you'd otherwise do in Java. It opens the door even further for additional savings compared to other languages in a similar place like Python or Ruby by providing macros.Freedom from the Kingdom of Nouns alone gives you a big win in readability. Naming things is hard, and when the thing you care about isn't the Class but the Method then bothering to name a wrapper Class is additional overhead, an extra \\\"what is this in my code?\\\" that you need to make room for in your brain -- additionally it's common practice in Java world to put that Class in its own file all by itself, often in a totally different namespace, and often physically far away from where it's actually used when looking at the files on the filesystem, which further increases the cognitive load of knowing where your code lives. IDEs in the land of Java are helpful only because they are necessary because without them the cognitive load is just too much for any reasonably complicated project.Freedom from mandatory static typing of the sort Java has saves you from pointless class wrappers, pointless POJOs that must have names and live in their own files and namespaces, you are free to just use maps of keywords to values. Free to work with the data directly rather than an ad-hoc aliasing scheme that might decide to hide things you need or surprise you with nulls. When you want protocol or interface adherence, it is there for you, but it is not mandatory for everything.Maintaining Clojure is easier because there's less of it. A new hire can be pointed to your code of n files and told to spend a week reading and playing in the REPL, versus pointed to n2 files and told to spend a month reading and inserting breakpoints here and there to understand all the chaotic flows across what and where. You have a legitimate shot at picking 10 random Clojure files out of the project and understanding a bit about the data flows in them in relationship to the project as a whole, but in Java you're going to need a lot more context, especially if you get unlucky and pick out 10 MyCustomException classes. What is there in Clojure can be very dense, but it can be apparent in code review when you went too far, and then it's easy to refactor and you don't need any auto-refactor tools. You just substitute expressions, add comments, and name only what needs to be named, you can do it all without constantly needing to restart your program because (unless you're using JRebel) you added a function here or changed a parameter there.Java is good for risk-averse corporations -- a single average Dev on an average size team can't do very much, many corporate programmers average around 1000-2000 lines of code per year* even with their IDEs helping them, and because of that they can cheaply be replaced or moved to another part of the project.\",\n          \"title\": null,\n          \"type\": \"comment\",\n          \"url\": null\n        },\n        {\n          \"author\": \"jiyinyiyong\",\n          \"children\": [],\n          \"created_at\": \"2015-12-03T13:05:39.000Z\",\n          \"created_at_i\": 1449147939,\n          \"id\": 10669329,\n          \"options\": [],\n          \"parent_id\": 10665633,\n          \"points\": null,\n          \"story_id\": 10657435,\n          \"text\": \"Well, not everyone thinks Java is easy to read.

How much time a developper spend to read the API implementation code of his language or even the framework ? No time because the code is great, work as expected and doesn't require to be read all the time.That's what a more expressive language provide. At greater set of standard language construct, API and frameworks that allow you to express the same in a much more concise way. This is much easier to read because the fundations are rock solid and the meaning of a function doesn't evolve over time, it is also nearly bug free. You reduce the accidental complexity.When you choose a less expressive language like Java, even with the most advenced frameworks you have much more unreliable custom code. You are in fact increasing the readability issue, not reducing it.Sure there the fact that many more developper master Java and the associated frameworks than say Scala or Clojure. But this also act as a filter.You can do the same thing with a team of 5 experienced clojure developpers than with 20-30 java dev. A part come from the language expressivity itself. A part is that it is much more likely to get bad developpers in Java that will mess your code and make you loose time. It is easy to find Java dev, a bit less to find great Java developpers. Another part is that the bigger the team, the more is lost in communication, meetings and politics than actually doing things.So that your choice ! Do you prefer 5 clojure dev, maybe paid 20-30% more or 30 java dev with 5 managers (paid 20-30% more) competiting to get budget and projects ?\",\n          \"title\": null,\n          \"type\": \"comment\",\n          \"url\": null\n        }\n      ],\n      \"created_at\": \"2015-12-02T20:39:29.000Z\",\n      \"created_at_i\": 1449088769,\n      \"id\": 10665633,\n      \"options\": [],\n      \"parent_id\": 10657435,\n      \"points\": null,\n      \"story_id\": 10657435,\n      \"text\": \"\\\" However, we had a strong aversion to using Java itself, so the real short list was Scala or Clojure.\\\"Sadly they couldn't articulate any actual problems with Java...I find it weird that so many developers focus on the \\\"writability\\\" of the language. I mean  stuff that java gets criticized for, like verbosity etc. Which I don't even find so bad especially since the newer jdk versions.But in my opinion the _readability_ of the result is the most important factor. I rather read copy/pasted code than some smart clojure onliner which nobody dares to touch or really understands.You only write the program once, but you have to read it over and over again when maintaining it and developing new features, and java's maybe a little verbose syntax really helps here, and also the fact that there really is only one way to do a thing (unlike eg. perl).The tooling, documentation, frameworks, libraries and runtimes are all top notch with java. All other languages seem to have problems in one (or more) of these areas.\",\n      \"title\": null,\n      \"type\": \"comment\",\n      \"url\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": \"vosper\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"author\": \"willvarfar\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"author\": \"kilink\",\n              \"children\": [\n                {\n                  \"author\": \"willvarfar\",\n                  \"children\": [],\n                  \"created_at\": \"2015-12-03T06:24:22.000Z\",\n                  \"created_at_i\": 1449123862,\n                  \"id\": 10668093,\n                  \"options\": [],\n                  \"parent_id\": 10666211,\n                  \"points\": null,\n                  \"story_id\": 10657435,\n                  \"text\": \"(pythonwheels doesn't do mysql nor postgres nor sqlalchmey nor ... most DBs in fact?)\",\n                  \"title\": null,\n                  \"type\": \"comment\",\n                  \"url\": null\n                }\n              ],\n              \"created_at\": \"2015-12-02T22:06:53.000Z\",\n              \"created_at_i\": 1449094013,\n              \"id\": 10666211,\n              \"options\": [],\n              \"parent_id\": 10665687,\n              \"points\": null,\n              \"story_id\": 10657435,\n              \"text\": \"Isn't that what Python Wheels are for though?http://pythonwheels.com/\",\n              \"title\": null,\n              \"type\": \"comment\",\n              \"url\": null\n            }\n          ],\n          \"created_at\": \"2015-12-02T20:48:14.000Z\",\n          \"created_at_i\": 1449089294,\n          \"id\": 10665687,\n          \"options\": [],\n          \"parent_id\": 10665635,\n          \"points\": null,\n          \"story_id\": 10657435,\n          \"text\": \"It matches my own experience too.

Feels right too, clojure does feel a lot like passing around similar clay bricks. When all the bricks line up, it's kind of like Lego?The analogy also opens up another difference.

With the stick model, you can often see how the sticks work if the bundle of sticks has been color coded nicely - eg, well constructed generics. Luckily cracking open a Clojure brick is as simple as ctrl-clicking, so it's not nearly as bad as it sounds!Programming parables are definitely weird though - programming does not have true analogies with the real world. It's more of a superset of the real world and the use of programming languages is more akin to defining physical laws than building bridges with clay or sticks.

The clay model is going to look nicer with rounded curves and no wasted points. The stick model will have bits sticking out.However when you get 30 people working together to make a big model, the clay model is going to start looking very strange indeed. Different people will have different finger pressure and shape the clay differently. Some people will make more right angled parts with the clay which will clash with the parts of the clay that are carefully smoothed out. Someone might spend a week fixing a perfect parabola for a curve at the top of the model just for someone else to bend it off to the side with an ugly twist to fit with the other side of the model.30 people on the stick model? Not really a problem. All the sticks look the same. Anybody who needs to attach one side of the stick model to something else just needs to grab a stick and tie it on. You won't see a perfect stick parabola, but then you also won't be stuck with a strangely twisted piece of clay.You can always create a style guide for using the clay - always keep between a 30 and 60 degree angle on joins. Apply one finger of pressure when doing joins. And so on. Sometimes this works with very diligent reviews that keep everything in place, but as soon as a crisis comes up or the model needs to pivot urgently? Everyone rushes to touch up the model in the quickest way possible and your model starts to get a bit thinner on one side than the other, etc.So there's nothing wrong with choosing a great clay model that fits well into your hand and you can shape effortlessly - but you need to remember that sometimes the 'painfulness' of using a model made out of sticks can be a big blessing when you're trying to massage a bit of clay that someone else pressed a bit too firmly on.EDIT:Also, when you've been making and using models for awhile, the stick models get an added benefit: you can browse through the stick models really fast based on only their outline and be able to understand very quickly how they work. Pretty clear why: the rigid sticks form a very distinct outline (think interfaces and forced directory structure in Java).

Instead of an inbox with an ID and a current state, you just store events that happened and a user might say show me the end state of the timeline that started at event d79se5k. They might also ask you for the timeline starting at a different point.There's no \\\"current state\\\". You're just ready to answer questions about hypothetical realities. And while some realities are more likely to be computed (and cached) that's only because they correspond to some key facts that a human is going to look up.Put another way, imagine a soup of unrelated facts. Your code is a way to project those facts into different mathematic spaces. You never just say \\\"what's the current state\\\" you have to actually write out specifically what you mean as a query.Sorry for the vagueness. I'm just putting out there my fuzzy understanding until someone else can write something better. :)I'm really interested this approach, and I think a lot of data should be immutable.

And by exotic I mean a language that stands out from the imperative or object-oriented crowd.I like how Clojure challenges established paradigms with a surprisingly mature ecosystem.Being a hosted language on the JVM has its pros and cons, but the cleverness and pragmatism of Rich Hickey (creator of Clojure) really stands out. He decided to go with an industry strong, battle-tested environment, effectively standing on the shoulders of giants, while providing a lot of fresh ideas.Also, the fact of being a Lisp can be seen from different angles: for some it's lots of weirdly nested parentheses, for others it has a beautifully simple, yet extremely powerful and expressive syntax.But don't let those aspects fool you. Once you scratch a little bit the surface, you will see the extraordinary power of its persistent data structures. For those who don't know what persistent data structures are: in Clojure, oversimplifying, there is no mutation to data structures. Every time you \\\"add\\\" or \\\"remove\\\" a key from a hash map, you are actually creating a copy of it. And in order to make this efficient, you need special data structures with \\\"superpowers\\\", that are not actually creating a whole copy of themselves, but rather modify atomically only a part (hint: trees).And having those data structures leads to the next big feature of Clojure: concurrency. Not only does Clojure provide a mechanism to dispatch thread-like constructs (core.async), but the whole language is designed around supporting concurrency.I also want to add that what really surprised me about Clojure is its thriving community and smart people using it. I am pretty sure that if you want to hire great, highly motivated talent, going Clojure will help you with that.\",\n      \"title\": null,\n      \"type\": \"comment\",\n      \"url\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"author\": \"giancarlostoro\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"author\": \"chii\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"author\": \"giancarlostoro\",\n              \"children\": [\n                {\n                  \"author\": \"vorg\",\n                  \"children\": [\n                    {\n                      \"author\": \"giancarlostoro\",\n                      \"children\": [],\n                      \"created_at\": \"2015-12-03T23:46:58.000Z\",\n                      \"created_at_i\": 1449186418,\n                      \"id\": 10673603,\n                      \"options\": [],\n                      \"parent_id\": 10668896,\n                      \"points\": null,\n                      \"story_id\": 10657435,\n                      \"text\": \"I do know Android Studio likes to rock Gradle.
