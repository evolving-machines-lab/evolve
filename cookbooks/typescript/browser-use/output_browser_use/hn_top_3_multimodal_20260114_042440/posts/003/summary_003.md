## Summary

ASCII Clouds is a creative visual project that generates ASCII art representations of clouds using procedural generation techniques. The project demonstrates an innovative approach to creating cloud-like patterns using ASCII characters and various noise generation algorithms. The website features an interactive visualization where users can adjust multiple parameters in real-time to customize the cloud generation, including cell size, wave amplitude, wave speed, noise intensity, and time speed. The black background with bright green ASCII characters creates a striking terminal-like aesthetic reminiscent of classic computer displays.

The visualization showcases the power of combining Perlin noise and wave functions to create organic, flowing patterns from discrete ASCII characters. The interactive controls allow users to experiment with different parameter combinations, providing insight into how various algorithms affect the visual output. This type of project appeals to developers interested in generative art, procedural content creation, and creative coding techniques that bridge the gap between technical implementation and artistic expression.
