  "summary": "Scott's blog post explores an ambitious experiment connecting an NVIDIA RTX 5090 graphics card to a Raspberry Pi to test gaming performance on ARM-based systems. The post documents the hardware setup, technical challenges with ARM GPU driver compatibility, and community-provided solutions. The author successfully demonstrates GPU acceleration on ARM single-board computers, overcoming memory alignment and DMA coherence issues through driver patches. Key findings show that while unconventional, high-end GPU gaming is achievable on budget Raspberry Pi platforms, representing an important proof of concept for GPU computing on ARM architectures.",
