Terence Tao has shared that Erdős Problem #728 has been solved more or less autonomously by AI. This represents a significant milestone in the application of artificial intelligence to mathematical problem-solving. The post discusses how AI systems can contribute to solving classic Erdős problems—a collection of famous open problems in mathematics. This achievement highlights the growing capability of machine learning systems to tackle complex mathematical challenges that have remained open for decades. The solution demonstrates how AI can analyze mathematical patterns, explore solution spaces exhaustively, and assist in proof construction and verification.
