An OpenJDK performance optimization that dramatically improved thread CPU time measurement on Linux systems through a clever 40-line fix. The new implementation uses direct clock_gettime() syscall with bit manipulation instead of parsing /proc filesystem, achieving 30x-400x performance improvement with latency reduced from ~11 microseconds to ~279 nanoseconds per operation. Available in JDK 26.
