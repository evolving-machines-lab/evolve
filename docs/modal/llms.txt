# Modal llms.txt

> Modal is a platform for running Python code in the cloud with minimal
> configuration, especially for serving AI models and high-performance batch
> processing. It supports fast prototyping, serverless APIs, scheduled jobs,
> GPU inference, distributed volumes, and sandboxes.

Important notes:

- Modal's primitives are embedded in Python and tailored for AI/GPU use cases,
  but they can be used for general-purpose cloud compute.
- Modal is a serverless platform, meaning you are only billed for resources used
  and can spin up containers on demand in seconds.

You can sign up for free at [https://modal.com] and get $30/month of credits.
