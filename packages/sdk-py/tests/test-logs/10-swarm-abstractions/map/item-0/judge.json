  "reasoning": "Candidate 0 successfully extracted data for all 33 units mentioned in the rent roll, including the 6 vacant units and 27 occupied/committed units. It correctly formatted all lease dates to the YYYY-MM-DD format as requested and accurately captured square footage and monthly rent figures. While Candidate 0 exhibited some tenant name mismatches (appearing to assign the tenant from the subsequent row to the unit above in some instances), it followed the schema and the 'VACANT' naming convention perfectly. Candidate 1, on the other hand, failed to produce any output file, resulting in an error. Therefore, Candidate 0 is the superior solution.",
