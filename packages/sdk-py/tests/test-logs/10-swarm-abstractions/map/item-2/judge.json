  "reasoning": "Candidate 0 provided more complete data, particularly regarding square footage. It correctly captured square footage from the LSF column when the RSF column was zero (e.g., units COGECO and MSC2), whereas Candidate 1 reported 0.0 in those cases. Candidate 0 also accurately transcribed unit numbers like 'STG10-1', which Candidate 1 truncated to 'STG10'. Both candidates followed the requested date format and rent accuracy requirements.",
