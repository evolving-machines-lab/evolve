  "overallRiskScore": 7,
  "reasoning": "The property exhibits high tenant concentration risk, with the top three tenants (The Capital Group, Bank of America, and Sheppard Mullin) accounting for 70.77% of total monthly rent. A critical concern is that 16.70% of the property's income is derived from leases that have already expired (primarily Sheppard Mullin), creating significant near-term cash flow uncertainty. Combined with a 20.38% vacancy rate and some non-standard low-rent leases (e.g., American Contemporary Ballet at $0.05 PSF), the property's risk profile is elevated."
