  "winnerIndex": 1,
  "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is selected as the winner because it strictly adheres to the evaluation criteria. Specifically: 1) Most complete unit data: Candidate 1 has significantly fewer null values (44) compared to Candidate 0 (75), primarily by using 0 instead of null for monthly rent in vacant or unspecified units. 2) Correct date formats: Both candidates used the required YYYY-MM-DD format correctly. 3) Accurate rent figures: Candidate 1 demonstrated higher accuracy in several key entries (e.g., Orange Theory's rent of 9,908 was correctly identified by Candidate 1, while Candidate 0 misidentified it as 9,898). Candidate 1 also followed the OCR values more precisely for units where the columns were slightly shifted. Additionally, Candidate 1 avoided the inclusion of a spurious empty unit entry present in Candidate 0's output.",
