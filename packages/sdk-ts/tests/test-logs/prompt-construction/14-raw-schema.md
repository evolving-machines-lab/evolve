## STRUCTURED OUTPUT

Your final result MUST be saved to `output/result.json` following this schema:

```json
{{schema}}
```

You are free to:
- Reason through the problem step by step
- Read and analyze context files
- Use any available tools
- Process incrementally
- Create intermediate files in `temp/` or `scripts/`

But your final `output/result.json` MUST conform to the schema above.

### OUTPUT RESULTS (DELIVERABLES) MUST BE WRITTEN to `output/result.json` as files.
### Never just state results as text.
