  "passed": true,
  "reasoning": "The worker's output successfully meets all verification criteria: (1) All 214 units from the PDF are extracted - the count matches exactly (87 occupied + 127 vacant = 214 total, as shown in the PDF summary on page 3). The building numbering skips floors 2100 and 2200 in the original PDF (jumps from 2000 to COGECO to 2300), which the worker correctly captured. (2) All dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format - verified programmatically with zero format violations. (3) Rent and square footage values are all numeric types. Spot-checks against specific units confirm accuracy: D100 Wells Fargo (53,250 sqft, $55,468.75), unit 1300 Bank of America (25,773 sqft, $73,710.78), C200 CallisonRTKL (24,640 sqft, $71,866.67), and unit 2900 Musick Peeler & Garrett (26,483 sqft, $64,000.59) all match the PDF values exactly. The property name 'BofA Plaza-Off, Los Angeles' is correctly captured.",
