  "passed": true,
  "reasoning": "The worker output was verified against the source PDF rent roll. Key findings: (1) The extraction captures units from all major buildings in the consolidated rent roll (Bridge North, Bridge South, Buick, City View Garage, Collins, Hermes, Jade, JBL, KVA, Laverne, Lee, Newton, Palm Court, Penny Lane, Twery buildings). (2) All dates are correctly formatted in YYYY-MM-DD format as required. Some entries show lease end dates before start dates (e.g., Dacra Storage, MDDA Property Mgt Office), but these match the source PDF data which shows unusual terms (99.0 years, 86.0 years) suggesting placeholder or special lease arrangements. (3) Rent and square footage values are numeric and reasonable - square footage ranges from 225 to 25,112 sq ft, monthly rents from $2,317 to $150,157, which aligns with the PDF data. (4) Vacant units are properly marked with 'VACANT' as tenant name and null values for lease dates and rent. (5) SNO (Signed Not Open) tenants are included with appropriate null values for rent. The worker extracted 117 unit entries which represents the distinct tenant/unit combinations from the consolidated rent roll.",
