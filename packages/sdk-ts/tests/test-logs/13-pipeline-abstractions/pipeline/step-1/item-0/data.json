  "overallRiskScore": 5,
  "reasoning": "Tenant Concentration (Low): The property has a well-diversified tenant base with 90+ units. The largest tenant (Harry Winston at $150,157/mo) represents only ~4.3% of total rent, and the top 10 tenants account for approximately 30% of income. The mix of luxury retail, office, and food/beverage tenants provides sector diversification. Lease Rollover (High): Significant near-term rollover exposure with major luxury tenants including Harry Winston ($150,157/mo), Dior Women ($87,284/mo), Givenchy ($53,437/mo), Loewe ($48,082/mo), and Loro Piana ($45,852/mo) all expiring in 2025. Combined with several other 2025-2026 expirations, approximately 17-20% of rental income ($600,000+/month) is at risk within 12-18 months. This concentrated rollover of high-profile luxury tenants poses meaningful re-leasing and downtime risk. Rent Collection (Medium): Multiple tenants show null rent values, including some occupied spaces marked as SNO (Signed Not Open) or TUA (Temporary Use Agreement), suggesting free rent periods or deferred rent starts. Several anomalous lease dates exist (e.g., end dates before start dates). There are 16+ vacant units generating no income. Some tenants appear to pay below-market rents (e.g., LSN Partners at ~$2.85/SF, State of Kid at ~$2.50/SF). However, the tenant roster includes creditworthy luxury brands (Hermes, Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Prada) which mitigates collection concerns. Overall Score (5/10): The property benefits from strong tenant credit quality and diversification but faces meaningful near-term lease rollover risk concentrated among key luxury tenants. The moderate vacancy and rent collection uncertainties from TUA/SNO arrangements add incremental risk. A score of 5 reflects balanced risk - not severe but requiring active asset management attention on lease renewals."
