  "reasoning": "Tenant Concentration Risk (HIGH): Top 3 tenants - The Capital Group Companies (31.7%), Bank of America (21.9%), and Sheppard Mullin Richter (15.4%) - account for approximately 69% of total monthly rent. Loss of any major tenant would significantly impact cash flow. Lease Rollover Risk (HIGH): As of January 2026, approximately 20% of rental income is from leases that have already expired (Sheppard Mullin's $431,578/month expired Dec 2024) or expire within 12 months (Wells Fargo $55,469, AT&T $23,420, Brown White & Newhouse $35,114). This creates substantial near-term uncertainty and re-leasing risk. Rent Collection Risk (HIGH): Multiple concerning indicators: (1) Several tenants occupy significant space paying $0 rent (333 South Hope Co LLC with 9,168 SF, Capital Group floor 5500 with 24,585 SF), (2) Dramatically below-market rents (American Contemporary Ballet pays $1,000/month for 22,314 SF = $0.53/SF/year vs Los Angeles Class A office market rates of $35-50+/SF), (3) High overall vacancy across many units. The combination of high concentration in few creditworthy tenants, significant near-term lease expirations (particularly the major Sheppard Mullin leases which appear already expired), numerous $0 rent tenants, and below-market lease structures suggests this property faces substantial financial risk requiring immediate attention to lease renewals and rent normalization."
